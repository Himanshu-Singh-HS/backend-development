                    "Description": "BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a structure for metering and sampling very small amounts of globules. More specifically, the invention relates to such a micro-globule metering and sampling structure suitable for use in performing analysis, chemical reaction, etc. using a variety of samples. The invention also relates to microchips having said structure within a substrate. There have heretofore been known a variety of apparatuses for performing analysis by electrophoresis, chromatography, etc. In order to provide accurate results of analysis by these apparatuses, globules of a sample and the like to be used must be metered and sampled quantitatively. Accordingly, various techniques have been proposed to ensure that globules of a sample and the like are metered and sampled quantitatively in the variety of apparatuses used in electrophoresis, chromatography, etc. See, for example, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 148628/1998 (in particular, FIGS. 1 and 2) which describes an electrophoretic apparatus in microchip form. Also see Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 198680/1995 (in particular, FIGS. 1 and 2) which describes an apparatus and method for separating a mixture of fluid substances by electrophoresis. However, each of these prior art methods must use more than necessary amounts of the sample to be analyzed and, hence, it has been impossible to reduce the dead volume of the sample. Microchips are also used to perform chemical reactions and analyses employing globules of a sample and the like in very small amounts. Again, in order to obtain accurate results with the microchip, globules of the sample and the like to be used must be metered and sampled quantitatively. In fact, however, the volume of the globules to be handled in microchip assay is so small that they are difficult to meter and sample quantitatively; as a result, various complex designs are required but then they must be operated by cumbersome procedures. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An object, therefore, of the present invention is to provide a micro-globule metering and sampling structure which is simple in structure and requires only simple procedures to achieve quantitative metering and sampling of very small amounts of globules. Another object of the invention is to provide a micro-globule metering and sampling structure which, when used in a variety of apparatuses that require quantitative handling of globules, can reduce the dead volume of the sample while saving the installation space and cost of the overall apparatus. These objects of the invention can be attained by the micro-globule metering and sampling structure of the invention which, being based on the surface tension of liquids, has been accomplished by taking advantage of the capillarity (capillary repulsion) a liquid exerts on a channel or a fluid passage. According to a first embodiment of the invention, there is provided a micro-globule metering and sampling structure having a first channel and a second channel that extend in specified directions, a third channel open to a wall of said first channel and a fourth channel that is open to a wall of said second channel such that it couples an end of said third channel to said second channel, that has a property of being less wettable (or insensitive to capillary attraction) and that is narrower than the other three channels, wherein a liquid introduced into said first channel is drawn into said third channel via the opening of said third channel which is open in a wall of said first channel and thereafter said liquid that remains in said first channel is removed to meter and sample a volume of globule equal to the capacity of said third channel. According to a second embodiment of the invention, there is provided a micro-globule metering and sampling structure having at least two systems each having a first channel and a second channel that extend in specified directions, a third channel open to a wall of said first channel and a fourth channel that is open to a wall of said second channel such that it couples an end of said third channel to said second channel, that has a property of being less wettable (or insensitive to capillary attraction) and that is narrower than the other three channels, wherein a liquid introduced into said first channel is drawn into said third channel via the opening of said third channel which is open in a wall of said first channel and thereafter said liquid that remains in said first channel is removed to meter and sample a volume of globule equal to the capacity of said third channel, said at least two systems sharing said first channel or said second channel. According to a third embodiment of the invention, there is provided a micro-globule metering and sampling structure in which two or more of said fourth channels are connected to said third channel or, alternatively, said fourth channel has two or more branches. According to a fourth embodiment of the invention, there is provided a micro-globule metering and sampling structure which has more than one set of said third channel and the fourth channel connected to it. According to a fifth embodiment of the invention, there is provided a micro-globule metering and sampling structure which further has a fifth channel that is open to a wall of said fourth channel, that is narrower than or equal in thickness to said fourth channel and that is made of a wall having a property of being less wettable (or insensitive to capillary attraction). According to a sixth embodiment of the invention, there is provided a micro-globule metering and sampling structure which further has means by which the globule that has been metered and sampled in a volume equal to the capacity of said third channel is allowed to flow into said second channel via said fourth channel. According to a seventh embodiment of the invention, there is provided a micro-globule metering and sampling structure which further has means by which the globule that has been metered and sampled in a volume equal to the capacity of said third channel is allowed to flow into said second channel via said fourth channel when said second channel is filled with a liquid up to the area which is near the opening of said fourth channel. According to an eighth embodiment of the invention, there is provided a micro-globule metering and sampling structure, wherein said first channel, said second channel, said third channel, said fourth channel and said fifth channel are each formed in a substrate.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Modes for carrying out the present invention as it relates to a micro-globule metering and sampling structure are described below in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. FIGS. 1A-1C illustrate the principle of the invention in conceptual form. Four channels, A (first channel), B (second channel), C (third channel) and D (fourth channel), are formed in such a way that channels C and C are cascaded in series between channels A and B, with channel C being followed by channel D in the direction of liquid flow. A liquid is first introduced into channel C via channel A. Channel D having a wall that is less wettable (or insensitive to capillary attraction) is narrower than the other channels, so a greater force is required to introduce the liquid into channel D; by exerting an appropriate pressure on it, the liquid can be allowed to stop at the interface c2 between channels C and D (see FIGS. 1A and 1B). More specifically, when a liquid 100 is introduced into channel A (as hatched in FIG. 1B), it can be further introduced into the narrower channel C via an opening cl that is open in a wall aa of channel A. If channels A and C have wettable walls, channel C may be made narrower than channel A and this ensures that liquid 100 is spontaneously drawn into channel C via opening cl under the action of stronger capillary attraction. If channels A and C have less wettable walls, liquid 100 can be introduced into channel C by exerting an appropriate pressure from an end of channel A (see FIG. 1B). Liquid 100 that has reached the other end c2 of channel C which connects to channel D ending at dl is blocked by the capillary repulsion of channel D having a less wettable wall and will not get into channel D. This is also true in the case where channel C has a less wettable wall because it develops a greater capillary repulsion than channel D (see FIG. 1B). Subsequently, residual liquid 100 in channel A is removed by, for example, creating a sufficient pressure difference across channel A that it moves toward the lower pressure side (see FIG. 1C). On this occasion, liquid 100 in channel C will not usually return into channel A (see FIG. 1C). As a result, two end faces 100a and 100b of the liquid 100 in channel C come into alignment with the opening cl of channel C and the end c2 at which it connects to channel D, making it possible to meter and sample a volume of globule equal to the capacity of channel C between c1 and c2 (see FIG. 1C). The globule formed within channel C can be easily introduced into channel B via channel D and its opening dl by, for example, creating a sufficient pressure difference between channels A and B that the pressure in the former is slightly higher than in the latter. As a result, the globule can be used for the purpose of reaction or analysis by, for example, pneumatic transfer. While various types of micro-globule metering and sampling structure are provided by the invention, the one set forth in claim 1 has a first channel (channel A) and a second channel (channel B) that extend in specified directions, a third channel (channel C) open to a wall of said first channel and a fourth channel (channel D) that is open to a wall of said second channel (channel B) such that it couples an end of said third channel (channel c) to said second channel (channel B), that has a property of being less wettable (or insensitive to capillary attraction) and that is narrower than the other three channels, wherein a liquid introduced into said first channel is drawn into said third channel via the opening of said third channel which is open in a wall of said first channel and thereafter said liquid that remains in said first channel is removed to meter and sample a volume of globule equal to the capacity of said third channel. Therefore, according to the structure set forth in claim 1, a globule of a volume equal to the capacity of the third channel can be formed by introducing a liquid from the first channel into the third channel. The structure is simple in structure and requires only simple procedures to achieve quantitative metering and sampling of globules. In addition, the structure can reduce the dead volume of the sample while saving the installation space and cost of the overall apparatus. The micro-globule metering and sampling structure set forth in claim 2 of the invention has at least two systems each having a first channel (channel A) and a second channel (channel B) that extend in specified directions, a third channel (channel c) open to a wall of said first channel and a fourth channel (channel D) that is open to a wall of said second channel (channel B) such that it couples an end of said third channel (channel C) to said second channel (channel B), that has a property of being less wettable (or insensitive to capillary attraction) and that is narrower than the other three channels, wherein a liquid introduced into said first channel is drawn into said third channel via the opening of said third channel which is open in a wall of said first channel and thereafter said liquid that remains in said first channel is removed to meter and sample a volume of globule equal to the capacity of said third channel, said at least two systems sharing said first channel or said second channel (see FIGS. 2A and 2B). As just described above, the two systems in the structure set forth in claim 2 share the first or second channel. If a plurality of globules of the same kind are quantitatively metered and sampled in each of the two systems sharing the first channel, globules of different kinds that have been metered and sampled in the two systems may be combined, diluted by combining, reacted by combining, subjected to analysis by reaction after combining, etc. in the second channels in the respective systems with globules of different kinds that have been metered and sampled in the respective systems (see FIG. 2A). On the other hand, if globules of different kinds are quantitatively metered and sampled in the two systems sharing the second channel, the prepared globules of different kinds may be combined, diluted by combining, reacted by combining, subjected to analysis by reaction after combining, etc. in the second channel common to the two systems (see FIG. 2B). As set forth in claim 3, the micro-globule metering and sampling structure according to claim 1 or 2 may be so modified that two or more of the fourth channels (channel D) are connected to the third channel (channel C) or, alternatively, the fourth channel (channel D) has two or more branches (see FIG. 3A). If this design is adopted, the velocity of the fluid in channel D can be adjusted independently of capillary repulsion. As set forth in claim 4, the micro-globule metering and sampling structure according to any one of claims 1-3 may be so modified that more than one set of the third channel (channel C) and the fourth channel (channel D) are formed (see FIG. 3B). If this design is adopted, plural sets of the third and fourth channels (channel C/channel D, channel Câ\u0080²/channel Dâ\u0080² and channel Câ\u0080³/channel Dâ\u0080³ in FIG. 3B) allow a plurality of globules of different volumes to be metered and sampled in a quantitative and parallel manner. As set forth in claim 5, the micro-globule metering and sampling structure according to any one of claims 1-4 may be so modified that it further has a fifth channel (channel E) that is open to a wall of said fourth channel (channel D), that is narrower than or equal in thickness to said fourth channel and that is made of a wall having a property of being less wettable (or insensitive to capillary attraction) (see FIG. 4). FIG. 4 illustrates in conceptual form the principle of the micro-globule metering and sampling structure set forth in claim 5. As shown in FIG. 4A, five channels, channel A, channel B, channel C, channel D and channel E, are provided in such a way that channels C and D are cascaded in series between channels A and B, with channel E having an opening e1 in a wall of channel D. Channel D has a wall having a property of being less wettable (or insensitive to capillary attraction), so if a liquid is introduced from channel A into channel C, it stops at the interface c2 between channels C and D and cannot be introduced into channel D without exerting a greater force. When a liquid 100 is introduced into the wide channel A (as hatched in FIG. 4B), it can be further drawn into narrower channel C via an opening cl that is open in a wall aa of channel A (see FIG. 4B) If channel B is not filled with the liquid up to the area near the opening dl of channel D, the above-described phenomenon is the same as what takes place in the structure according to any one of claims 1-4. However, in the case where a liquid 200 has been preliminarily introduced into channel B (as shaded in FIG. 4B), liquid 100 is introduced into channel C only incompletely in the structure according to any one of claims 1-4. This failure to achieve complete introduction of liquid 100 into channel C can be explained by the absence of any route for the escape of the residual gas in channel C. Assume here that in the structure set forth in claim 5, liquid 200 has already been introduced into channel B (as shaded in FIG. 4B). As liquid 100 is introduced into channel C, any gas that exits in the channel is purged into channel E (which is open to the atmosphere at the end opposite to the opening e1) (see FIG. 4B). In this case, too, liquid 100 that has reached the other end c2 of channel C at the interface with channel D is blocked by the capillary repulsion of channel D (the zone between c2 and dl) having a less wettable wall (or a wall insensitive to capillary attraction) and will not get into channel D (see FIG. 4B). Subsequently, the residual liquid 100 in channel A is removed by, for example, creating a sufficient pressure difference across channel A that it moves toward the lower pressure side. As a result, a volume of globule equal to the capacity of channel C (the zone between c1 and c2) can be metered and sampled (see FIG. 4C). The globule formed within channel C can be introduced into the liquid 200 in channel B via channel D by, for example, creating a sufficient pressure difference between channels A and B that the pressure in the former is slightly higher than in the latter. On this occasion, the end of channel E which is opposite the end e1 must be closed (see FIG. 4D). Thus, by using the structure set forth in claim 5, one can offer a practically feasible technique by which very small amounts of samples or reaction reagents can be quantitatively introduced into a variety of analyzers or reactors for use in electrophoresis, chromatography, etc. As set forth in claim 6, the micro-globule metering and sampling structure according to any one of claims 1-5 may be so modified that it further has means by which the globule that has been metered and sampled quantitatively in said third channel (channel C) is allowed to flow into said second channel (channel B) via said fourth channel (channel D) from its opening which is open in a wall of said second channel (channel B). Stated specifically, in order to ensure that the globule formed quantitatively in the third channel will flow into the second channel, the pressure in the first channel may be adjusted to be slightly higher than the pressure in the second channel by, for example, creating a sufficient pressure difference between the two channels or applying a centrifugal force in the direction in which the globule is to flow out. As the means for creating a sufficient pressure difference, a known conventional pressurizing or evacuating mechanism may be employed with advantage. Thus, by using the structure set forth in claim 6, the quantitatively metered and sampled globule in the third channel can be flowed into the second channel and very small amounts of samples or reaction reagents can be quantitatively introduced into a variety of analyzers or reactors for use in electrophoresis, chromatography, etc. As set forth in claim 7, the micro-globule metering and sampling structure according to claim 6 may be so modified that it further has means by which the globule that has been metered and sampled quantitatively in said third channel (channel C) is allowed to flow into said second channel (channel B) via said fourth channel (channel D) from the opening of said third channel which is open in a wall of said second channel when said second channel is filled with a liquid. Stated specifically, according to the invention set forth in claim 7, the globule formed quantitatively within the third channel using the structure set forth in claim 5 can be flowed into the second channel by, for example, creating a sufficient pressure difference between the first and second channels or applying a centrifugal force in the direction in which the globule is to flow out, with the end of channel E opposite e1 being closed, so that the pressure in the first channel becomes slightly higher than the pressure in the second channel. Thus, by using the structure set forth in claim 7, the quantitatively metered and sampled globule in the third channel can be flowed into the second channel and very small amounts of samples or reaction reagents can be quantitatively introduced into a variety of analyzers or reactors for use in electrophoresis, chromatography, etc. The micro-globule metering and sampling structure of the invention can be adapted to various operations including sample injection in electrophoresis of nucleic acids and proteins, and many other processes such as protein synthesis or separation and the synthesis and screening of chemical substances after rendering the surfaces or any other desirable areas of channels more wettable or less wettable or after performing the necessary treatments that are compatible with the surface properties of proteins and DNA. As set forth in claim 8, the micro-globule metering and sampling structure according to any one of claims 1-7 may be so modified that said first channel (channel A), said second channel (channel B), said third channel (channel C), said fourth channel (channel D) and said fifth channel (channel E) are each formed in a substrate. Thus, the structure set forth in claim 8 is simple in structure and requires only simple procedures to achieve quantitative metering and sampling of globules in very small volumes; in addition, the structure can achieve further reduction in the dead volume of the sample, as well as in the installation space and cost of the overall apparatus. As set forth in claim 9, the micro-globule metering and sampling structure according to any one of claims 1-8 may be so modified that said third channel is formed to have a capacity in the range of the picoliter to microliter order. Thus, the structure set forth in claim 8 is simple in structure and requires only simple procedures to achieve quantitative metering and sampling of globules in very small volumes ranging from the picoliter to microliter order. EXAMPLE 1 FIG. 5A shows a microchip having the micro-globule metering and sampling structure of the invention. The microchip generally indicated by 10 in FIG. 5A is intended to perform capillary ion-exchange chromatography in protein analysis and has the micro-globule metering and sampling structure of the invention in the sample injecting portion. Referring further to FIG. 5A, ports 11 and 12 are intended for introducing protein eluting buffers. Buffers of different ionic strengths as introduced at these two ports are flowed in varying quantities and mixed in a mixer 13 to form a gradient of ionic strength. Having this function, each of the ports 11 and 12 is open to the atmosphere at the top but communicates to channels at the bottom. A microchannel 14 is a chromatographic column and packed with ion-exchange beads in a 3-mm zone between a bead blockade 15 and the micro-globule metering and sampling structure (b). Located at the far end of the microchannel 14 which is away from the bead blockade 15 is a port 18. Useful ion-exchange beads are the anion-exchange beads that are manufactured by Pharmacia in a size of 30 Î¼m. The micro-globule metering and sampling structure (b) is shown enlarged in FIG. 5B. The microchip 10 is a square which is 20 mm on each side and 5 mm thick; it is fabricated by placing two planar substrates, upper substrate 16 and lower substrate 17, in superposition and binding them together; the substrates are formed of a polymeric material such as PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane). The length of each side of the microchip, its shape and thickness are not limited to any particular values; for example, the length of each side may be set at any desired values in the range of 5-100 mm. Microchannels are formed in the lower surface of the upper substrate 16 and in the upper surface of the lower substrate 17. The microchannels in the lower surface of the substrate 16 have a different depth (100 Î¼m) than those in the upper surface of the substrate 17 (which are 10 Î¼m deep). One of the characteristics of PDMS is that its surface exhibits hydrophobicity when hardened. In addition, PDMS becomes easily bondable either to itself or glass and the like upon treatment by irradiation with an O2 plasma or an excimer laser. For these two reasons, PDMS is suitable for use in the fabrication of the micro-globule metering and sampling structure. Depending on where in the microchip 10 the microchannels are to be formed (i.e., whether in the lower surface of the upper substrate 16 or in the upper surface of the lower substrate 17), the microchannel depth can be locally set to either the smaller or greater value which are selected as appropriate from the range of 1-200 Î¼m. The arrangement of the microchannels in the micro-globule metering and sampling structure (b) are shown in detail in FIGS. 5B and 5C1. Formed in the lower surface of the upper substrate 16 are the first channel 19 and the second channel 20 which are parallel to each other and extend from right to left and the third channel 21 which is connected to the first channel 19 and directed normal to the second channel 2; formed in the upper surface of the lower substrate 17 are the fourth channel 22 connecting the second channel 20 and the third channel 21 and the fifth channel 23 which branches off from the fourth channel 22 in a direction normal to it. If shallow and narrow channels are to be formed in the upper surface of the lower substrate 17, channel communication can be established by allowing them to overlap partly with the deep and wide channels formed in the lower surface of the upper substrate 16. Alternatively, as shown in FIG. 5C2, all channels may be formed in the upper substrate 16 (or in the lower substrate 17) to eliminate the need to provide partial overlap between channels. This approach of forming all channels in one substrate can be adopted by appropriately choosing the synthetic resin material for the substrate and/or by rendering more wettable or less wettable all or part of the surfaces or other necessary areas of specified channels to be formed in the substrate. The first channel 19 and the second channel 20 have a width of 200 Î¼m, the third channel 21 has a width of 100 Î¼m, the fourth channel 22 has a width of 20 Î¼m, and that part of the fifth channel 23 which is contiguous to the fourth channel 22 also has a width of 20 Î¼m. In order to ensure that a liquid will not easily get into the fourth channel 22, it must be narrower than the first channel 19, the second channel 20 and the third channel 21; likewise, in order to ensure that a liquid will not easily get into the fifth channel 23, its thickness must be equal to or smaller than the thickness of the fourth channel 22. The fabrication of the microchip 10 starts with the preparation of photolithographic masks. In this preliminary step, the patterns for the layouts of the microchannels to be formed in the upper substrate 16 and the lower substrate 17 are printed on separate clear films at high resolution (e.g. 4064 dpi). In the next step, a silicon (Si) wafer is diced with a diamond cutter to the dimensions of the microchip to be fabricated. The blank is then washed by sonication, dried and subjected to an O2 plasma treatment in a plasma reactor at 200 W for 30 seconds. Then, the blank is spin coated with a negative-acting photoresist SU-8 50 or SU-8 (if 100-Î¼m channels are to be formed, SU-8 50 is applied at 2000 rpm for 10 seconds; if 10-Î¼m channels are to be formed, SU-8 is applied at 2000 rpm for 10 seconds) and allowed to stand in an oven at 90Â° C. for 30 minutes. Then, using a mask aligner, the patterns (printed on films) for the layouts of the microchannels to be formed in the upper substrate 16 and the lower substrate 17 of the microchip 10 are transferred to the separate SU-8 or S8 50 coated silicon wafers by photolithography. After standing in an oven at 90Â° C. for 30 minutes, the wafers are dipped in a developer (e.g. 1-methoxy-2-propyl acetate), washed successively with isopropyl alcohol and distilled water, and dried. The thus prepared masters have embossed structures and can be used as templates for the microchannels to be formed in the upper substrate 16 and the lower substrate 17. In order to facilitate the removal of PDMS replicas after molding, the masters are surface treated by being allowed to stand in a 3% dimethyloctadecylchlorosilane/toluene solution for 2 hours before pouring in a PDMS prepolymer. Then, a 10:1 mixture of a PDMS prepolymer and a curing reagent (e.g. Sylgard 184 of Dow Corning Co., MI) is well agitated, poured into polyacrylic frames holding the masters, and cured by standing at 90Â° C. for 30 minutes. After curing, the PDMS replicas are detached from the masters, leaving the upper substrate 16 and the lower substrate 17 of the microchip 10 behind. The lower surface of the upper substrate 16 and the upper surface of the lower substrate 17 are treated with an O2 plasma and bonded together to form the microchip 10. Using the thus fabricated microchip 10, one can meter and sample very small amounts of globules as follows in the actual practice of sample injection. To begin with, a sample is introduced into the first channel 19 at an end under the action of a pressure flow until it fills the first channel 19 and the third channel 21. The sample will not get into the fourth channel 22 since it has a property of being less wettable or insensitive to capillary attraction and is sufficiently narrower than the first channel 19, the second channel 20 and the third channel 21 that it does not easily wet with a hydrophilic liquid. If the second channel 20 is filled with a liquid in the absence of the fifth channel 23, air in the third channel 21 will leak into the second channel 20 as the sample is introduced into the third channel 21. In fact, however, the micro-globule metering and sampling structure (b) has the fifth channel 23, so even if the second channel 20 is filled with a liquid, air in the third channel 21 will escape into the fifth channel 23 and the sample can be smoothly introduced into the third channel 21 without causing air to leak into the second channel 20. Subsequently, air is introduced into the first channel 19 under the action of a pressure flow, whereupon the sample is pushed out of the first channel 19 and only remains in the third channel 21. The sample in the third channel 21 will not flow back into the first channel 19. The microchip under consideration is so designed that 5 nL of sample will remain in the third channel 21. Subsequently, the pressure in the first channel 19 is increased, whereupon the sample in the third channel 21 leaks into the fourth channel 22 and thence flows into the second channel 20. Since the exit of the fifth channel 23 is closed, there will be no leakage of the sample into the fifth channel 23 and it is effectively introduced into the second channel 20. In order to lower the possibility of the sample to leak into the fifth channel 23, the width of the fifth channel is desirably equal to or smaller than the width of the fourth channel 22. In the case under consideration, the fourth channel 22 and the fifth channel 23 are both set to a width of 20 Î¼m. In order to ensure that the sample (e.g. protein) to be separated by chromatography will not adsorb to PDMS, the wall surfaces of the first channel 19, the second channel 20 and the third channel 21 are rendered hydrophilic by treatment with HCl. The method of providing hydrophilic surfaces is not limited to the treatment with HCl and the same result can be attained by using an O2 plasma or albumin. PDMS itself is a hydrophobic substance. Chromatography was actually done performing sample injection by the above-described micro-globule metering and sampling procedure: a solution of a mixture of FITC-labelled albumin and IgG was introduced as a sample while Tris/HCl buffer (pH 8.0) was flowed at a rate of 1.0 Î¼L/min to effect adsorption on anion-exchange beads (product of Pharmacia; bead size, 30 Î¼m); by using a 0-1 M gradient of NaCl buffer, albumin and IgG could be separated within one minute. In Example 1, the micro-globule metering and sampling structure was fabricated of PDMS. This is not the sole case of the invention and the structure is compatible with a wide variety of materials (e.g. silicon, polymers, glass, ceramics and metals) if the wettability of the interior of channels can be adjusted by rendering part or all of their surfaces and/or end faces either more wettable or less wettable. The structure can also be fabricated by using composites of the above-mentioned materials or mixing them with suitable substances such as a temperature- and pH-responsive PIPAAm (N-isopropylacrylamide). EXAMPLE 2 FIG. 6A is a plan view of a microchip employing the micro-globule metering and sampling structure according to another example of the invention. The microchip generally indicated by 24 in FIG. 6A is capable of carrying out up to 50 kinds of reaction or analysis individually by mixing two quantitatively metered and sampled liquids. It adopts the micro-globule metering and sampling structure in the globule metering and sampling portion. The microchip 24 shown in FIG. 6A is capable of carrying out up to 50 kinds of reaction or analysis. Of course, microchips capable of carrying out a greater number of reactions or analyses can be fabricated. Using the microchip 24 shown in FIG. 6A, one can mix a single reagent with up to 50 kinds of sample and carry out reactions or analyses individually and simultaneously by an extremely simple procedure. Alternatively, one can mix a single sample with up to 50 kinds of reagent and carry out reactions or analyses individually and simultaneously. As in the case of the microchip 10 shown in FIG. 5, the microchip 24 shown in FIG. 6A can be fabricated by placing two planar substrates in superposition and binding them together. The substrates are formed of a polymeric material such as PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane). The microchip 24 is a disk 90 mm across and 3 mm thick. Other values of diameter and thickness can of course be employed. The shape of the microchip 24 is not limited to a disk and it can be formed from rectangular or polygonal substrates. Speaking further of the microchip 24 shown in FIG. 6A, microchannels are formed in the lower surface of the upper substrate 25 and in the upper surface of the lower substrate 26. The microchannels in the lower surface of the substrate 25 have a different depth (say, 100 Î¼m) than those in the upper surface of the substrate 26 (which may be 10 Î¼m deep). Other values of thickness can of course be adopted. FIG. 6B is an enlarged view of area (b) of the microchip 24 shown in FIG. 6A, and FIG. 6C is an enlarged view of area (c) shown in FIG. 6B. As shown in FIG. 6B, the first liquid supply channel 33 which is in the center of the microchip 24 and is generally of a ring shape has one interruption; one end of the interruption connects to and communicates with a port 28 via a channel 27 that extends radially outward and the other end connects to and communicates with a port 30 via a channel 29 that also extends radially outward. Port 28 is an inlet for the first liquid to be mixed and port 30 is an outlet for the same liquid. The liquid introduced at the port 28 flows into the first liquid supply channel 33 via channel 27 and, after flowing through the first liquid supply channel 33, comes out of the port 30 via channel 29. Alternatively, port 28 may be used as an outlet for the first liquid and port 30 as an inlet. Further referring to FIG. 6B, a port 31a is an inlet for the second liquid to be mixed and communicates with an exit port 31b via the second liquid supply channel 35. Since the inlet port 31a communicates with the exit port 31b via the second liquid supply channel 35, a liquid injected from the inlet port 31a can easily fill the second liquid supply channel 35 by suitable means such as pneumatic pressure. Port 31a communicates with an adjacent port 32a via a mixing channel 34 and port 31b communicates with an adjacent port 32b via the same mixing channel 34. The mixing channel 34 also functions as a chamber in which two mixed globules react with each other. Since the ports 32a and 32b communicate with each other via the mixing channel 34, pneumatic pressure may be applied into the mixing channel 34 via the port 32a and/or port 32b so as to promote the mixing of globules in the channel or recover the reaction product out of the channel. Provided radially outward of the first liquid supply channel 33 are thirty structures for metering, sampling and mixing micro-globules, each consisting of ports 31a, 31b and the second liquid supply channel 35, as well as ports 32a, 32b and the mixing channel 34. Twenty similar structures for metering, sampling and mixing micro-globules are provided radially inward of the first liquid supply channel 33. The number of the structures for metering, sampling and mixing micro-globules that can be provided is in no way limited to the illustrated embodiment. The structure shown in FIG. 6C is fabricated for the same purpose as the structure shown in FIG. 2B and it consists of a microchannel structure for metering and sampling two micro-globules and a channel for mixing them. As shown, a first liquid supply channel 33 for supplying one liquid (which corresponds to channel A in FIG. 2B) and a second liquid supply channel 35 for supplying the other liquid (which corresponds to channel Aâ\u0080² in FIG. 2B) are provided on opposite sides of a mixing channel 34 which functions as a reaction chamber (corresponding to channel B in FIG. 2B). One liquid being supplied from the first liquid supply channel 33 is metered and sampled in a given quantity by means of a first metering and sampling channel 36 (corresponding to channel C in FIG. 2B). Similarly, the other liquid being supplied from the second liquid supply channel 35 is metered and sampled in a given quantity by means of a second metering and sampling channel 37 (corresponding to channel Câ\u0080² in FIG. 2B). By common means such as pressure difference, the globules in the channels 36 and 37 are passed through a first narrower channel 38 and a second narrower channel 39, respectively, and introduced into the mixing channel 34, where they are mixed together. Further referring to FIG. 6, the first liquid supply channel 33 for supplying one liquid, the second liquid supply channel 35 for supplying the other liquid and the mixing channel 34 may each have a width of 200 Î¼m; the first metering and sampling channel 36 and the second metering and sampling channel 37 may each have a width of 100 Î¼m and a length of 600 Î¼m; the first narrower channel 38 and the second narrower channel 39 may each have a width of 20 Î¼m. Other values of channel width and length may of course be employed. Referring to FIG. 6C, the two liquids to be mixed each weigh 6 nL and this volume is equal to the capacity of the first metering and sampling channel 36 and the second metering and sampling channel 37. Hence, by changing the capacity of these channels, the volume of the two liquids to be mixed is freely adjustable within the range of 1 Î¼L to 1 Î¼L. The microchip 24 shown in FIG. 6 can be fabricated by the same process as what is employed to manufacture the microchip 10 shown in FIG. 5. One application of the microchip 24 shown in FIG. 6 is in metering, sampling and mixing micro-globules for the purpose of performing quantitative analysis of glucose by the glucose oxidase/peroxidase method. To perform metering, sampling and mixing micro-globules for the purpose of performing quantitative analysis of glucose by the glucose oxidase/peroxidase method, the following procedure is taken. In the glucose oxidase/peroxidase method, a phosphate buffer containing a mixture of glucose oxidase, peroxidase, mutarotase, 4-aminoantipyrine and phenol in suitable amounts is used as a reagent and an aqueous glucose solution is used as a sample. First, about 1 Î¼L of the reagent is introduced in a direction from port 28 toward port 30 (FIG. 6A) under the action of pressure flow and thereafter air is introduced in order to displace the superfluous reagent. The introduced reagent and air flow clockwise through the first liquid supply channel 33. Referring to FIG. 6C, the first narrower channel 38 is hydrophobic and less wettable with a liquid and it has a smaller width than the first liquid supply channel 33 and the first metering and sampling channel 36; hence, the reagent introduced into the first metering and sampling channel 36 is retained in that channel and will not get into the first narrower channel 38. As a result, a globule of the reagent can be metered and sampled within the first metering and sampling channel 36 in a volume which is equal to the capacity of that channel As a further advantage, the introduction of the reagent in a direction from port 28 toward port 30 and the subsequent air introduction need to be performed only once to ensure that globules of the reagent in predetermined amounts are metered and sampled in a single step within the 50 first metering and sampling channels 36. By means of this very simple procedure, a micro-globule is further divided and a great number of droplets can be formed simultaneously in much smaller quantities. It is also anticipated that only an extremely small amount of the liquid will remain undistributed at the end of the procedure. Subsequently, as in the case of the reagent, the sample is introduced in a direction from port 31a toward port 31b and a globule of the sample can be metered and sampled in a predetermined amount within the second metering and sampling channel 37 via the second liquid supply channel 35. In the next step, the pneumatic pressure within the first liquid supply channel 33 and the second liquid supply channel 35 is elevated, whereupon the reagent in the first metering and sampling channel 36 and the sample in the second metering and sampling channel 37 are pushed into the mixing channel 34, where they are mixed together. The resulting mixture reddens through chemical reaction and by evaluating the hue of the red color, quantitative analysis of glucose can be accomplished. Needless to say, the microchip 24 shown in FIG. 6 can also be used in other qualitative and/or quantitative analyses. As described above, the present invention provides a micro-globule metering and sampling structure which is simple in structure and requires only simple procedures to achieve quantitative metering and sampling of very small amounts of globules. The invention also provides a micro-globule metering and sampling structure which, when used in a variety of apparatuses that require quantitative handling of globules, can reduce the dead volume of the sample while saving the installation space and cost of the overall apparatus."

                    "Description": "RELATED APPLICATIONS This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/750,408, entitled An Apparatus and Associated Methods to Perform Space-Frequency Interleaving in a Multicarrier Wireless Communication Channel, filed on Dec. 31, 2003 now U.S. Pat. No. 7,573,946. TECHNICAL FIELD Embodiments of the present invention are generally directed to a wireless communication system and, more particularly, to methods and apparatus to perform space-frequency interleaving in a multicarrier wireless communication channel. BACKGROUND A multicarrier communication system such as, e.g., Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM), Discrete Multi-tone (DMT) and the like, is typically characterized by a frequency band associated with a communication channel being divided into a number of smaller sub-bands (subcarriers herein). Communication of information (e.g., data, audio, video, etc.) between stations in a multicarrier communication system is performed by dividing the informational content into multiple pieces (e.g., symbols), and then transmitting the pieces in parallel via a number of the separate subcarriers. When the symbol period transmitted through a subcarrier is longer than a maximum multipath delay in the channel, the effect of intersymbol interference may be significantly reduced. While multicarrier communication systems hold the promise of high throughput communication channels, technical challenges persist. For example, in certain applications such as, for example a wireless local area network (WLAN) deep fades can occur in the channel that may persist over a significant period of time. Further, due to environmental conditions (e.g., home office, business, etc.), the wireless channels may typically encounter significant dispersion due to multipath propagation that limits the maximum achievable rates. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Embodiments of the present invention are illustrated by way of example, and not by way of limitation, in the figures of the accompanying drawings in which like reference numerals refer to similar elements and in which: FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example multicarrier wireless network incorporating the teachings of the present invention, according to one example implementation; FIG. 2 is a block diagram of an example transceiver incorporating the teachings of the present invention, according to one example implementation; FIG. 3 is a flow chart of an example method for mapping information to one or more antenna(e) and subcarrier(s), according to one embodiment of the invention; FIG. 4 is a flow chart of an example method for mapping information to one or more antenna(e) and subcarrier(s), according to one embodiment of the invention; FIGS. 5 and 6 provide graphical illustrations of transmit diversity and space-frequency interleaving for two transmit antennas, in accordance with embodiments of the present invention; FIG. 7 is a graphical illustration of the improvement to one or more channel characteristics through use of an embodiment of the invention; FIG. 8 provides a graphical illustration of the improvement to one or more channel characteristics through use of an embodiment of the invention; and FIG. 9 is a block diagram of an example article of manufacture including content which, when executed by an accessing machine, causes the machine to implement one or more aspects of embodiment(s) of the invention. FIG. 10 is a flow chart of an example method for interleaving in a multicarrier wireless communication channel, according to embodiments of the invention. DETAILED DESCRIPTION Embodiments of an apparatus and associated methods to control transmission of a multicarrier wireless communication channel are generally introduced herein. In this regard, aspects of the present invention may well be used to implement any of a number of wireless communication platforms such as, e.g., wireless local area network (WLAN), wireless personal area network (WPAN), wireless metro-area networks (WMAN), cellular networks, and the like. With this disclosure, an innovative approach to improving the resilience of the multicarrier communication channel is disclosed, wherein an advanced OFDM processing technique is added to a multiple input, multiple output (MIMO) transceiver that utilizes more than one transmit/receive chain at each end of the wireless link. Those skilled in the art will appreciate, in view of the following discussion, that the disclosed combination of MIMO and OFDM (MIMO-OFDM) appears particularly promising for high-throughput wireless LAN application. According to a first aspect of the invention, a transmit diversity capability is introduced, which provides a near-optimal method for mapping uncoded content (e.g., quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) symbols) received from a host device, or an application/agent executing thereon, to multiple antennas and OFDM tones. While the transmit diversity architecture introduced herein provides full-order diversity, it may only provide a limited code rate per OFDM slot. According to another aspect of the invention, the transmit diversity architecture is extended to provide a higher code rate by means of space-frequency interleaving (SFI). As developed more fully below, SFI provides a near-optimal technique for mapping coded information (e.g., bits, frames, symbols, etc.) onto multiple antennas and OFDM tones. Reference throughout this specification to â\u0080\u009cone embodimentâ\u0080\u009d or â\u0080\u009can embodimentâ\u0080\u009d means that a particular feature, structure or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the present invention. Thus, appearances of the phrases â\u0080\u009cin one embodimentâ\u0080\u009d or â\u0080\u009cin an embodimentâ\u0080\u009d in various places throughout this specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment. Furthermore, the particular features, structures or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments. Example Network Environment FIG. 1 illustrates a block diagram of a wireless communication environment within which the teachings of the present invention may be practiced. As shown, network 100 depicts two devices 102, 104, each comprising one or more wireless transmitter(s) and receiver(s) (cumulatively, a transceiver) 108, 116, baseband and media access control (MAC) processing capability 112, 114, and memory 110, 118, each coupled as shown. As used herein, the devices 102, 104 communicate information between one another via a multicarrier wireless communication channel 106, established between the transceiver(s) 108, 116 through one or more antenna(e) associated with the devices. According to one embodiment, one of the devices 102 may be coupled to another network 120. According to one aspect of the invention, an innovative diversity agent is introduced within the device(s) introduce and manage one or more elements of diversity within the multicarrier wireless channel. On the transmit side of a communication channel, the diversity agent may selectively map content (e.g., received from a host device, application, agent, etc.) to one or more antenna(e) and/or OFDM tones to generate a MIMO-OFDM transmit signal. In support of the receive side of the communication channel, the diversity agent may selectively demap the content received via the MIMO-OFDM wireless channel (e.g., 106) from multiple antennas and OFDM tones. While not specifically denoted in FIG. 1, the diversity agent may well be implemented in one or more of the baseband and MAC processing element(s) (112, 114) and/or the transceiver element(s) (108, 116), although the invention is not so limited. According to one example embodiment, the diversity agent may selectively process content received from the host device (e.g., 102, 104) to implement full-order transmit diversity, although the invention is not limited in this respect. As developed below, diversity agent may map uncoded content (e.g., quadrature amplitude modulated (QAM) symbols) received from the host device (102, 106) or applications executing thereon, onto multiple antennas and OFDM tones to effect spatial diversity in the transmit link of channel (106). According to one embodiment, the diversity agent may selectively process content received from the host device (e.g., 102, 104) to introduce space-frequency interleaving (SFI) of the content onto multiple antennas and OFDM tones. In this regard, as developed below, diversity agent may selectively map coded information (e.g., bits, bytes, blocks, symbols, frames, packets, etc.) received from the host device or applications executing thereon, onto multiple antennas and OFDM tones by performing one or more of antenna multiplexing, 802.11a interleaving, QAM mapping, and cyclic tone shifting, although the invention is not limited in this regard. In addition to the foregoing, the diversity agent may selectively implement an innovative technique(s) for decoding information from a received OFDM channel processed as above. In this regard, an innovative receive diversity agent is introduced to demap and/or deinterleave content received from a channel 106 generated in accordance with one or both of the encoding techniques introduced above. According to one embodiment, receive diversity agent receives content as decoded modulation information (e.g., bits) and generates de-mapped and/or de-interleaved content, respectively. But for the introduction of the diversity agent introduced above, devices 102, 104 are intended to represent any of a wide range of electronic devices with wireless communication capability including, for example, a laptop, palmtop or desktop computer, a cellular telephone (e.g., a 2G, 2.5G, 3G or 4G handset), a personal digital assistant, an WLAN access point (AP), a WLAN station (STA), and the like. As used herein, baseband and MAC processing element(s) 112, 114 may be implemented in one or more processors (e.g., a baseband processor and an application processor), although the invention is not limited in this regard. As shown, the processor element(s) 112, 114 may couple to memory 110, 118, respectively, which may include volatile memory such as DRAM, non-volatile memory such as Flash memory, or alternatively may include other types of storage such as a hard disk drive, although the cope of the invention is not limited in this respect. Some portion or all of memory 110, 118 may well be disposed within the same package as the processor element(s) 112, 114, or may be disposed on an integrated circuit or some other medium external to element(s) 112, 114. According to one embodiment, baseband and MAC processing element(s) 112, 114 may implement at least a subset of the features of diversity agent described below, and/or may provide control over a diversity agent implemented within an associated transceiver (108, 116), although the invention is not limited in this regard. Similarly, but for the introduction of the diversity agent to effect the MIMO-OFDM channelization developed more fully below, transceivers 108, 116 are also intended to reflect any of a variety of multicarrier wireless communication transceivers known in the art. In this regard, a transmitter element of the transceivers receive content from a host device, process the received content to generate an OFDM transmit signal, and then transmits that OFDM signal over a link (e.g., forward link) to a remote device via one or more antennae. A receiver element of the receivers receives multiple instances of the forward link via one or more antenna(e), and selectively processes the received signal(s) to extract a representation of the originally encoded content. Again, the introduction of the diversity agent enables the wireless transceiver within the device(s) to implement the MIMO-OFDM features described below. According to one embodiment, each of the transmitters and receivers may well include one or more processing chains. As used herein, network 120 is intended to represent any of a broad range of communication networks including, for example a plain-old telephone system (POTS) communication network, a local area network (LAN), metropolitan area network (MAN), wide-area network (WAN), global area network (Internet), cellular network, and the like. According to one example implementation, device 102 represents an access point (AP), while device 104 represents a station (STA), each of which suitable for use within an IEEE 802.11n wireless local area network (WLAN), and each utilizing the innovative space-frequency interleaving and transmit diversity techniques introduced above, and developed more fully below. Example Transceiver Architecture FIG. 2 illustrates a block diagram of an example transmitter architecture and an example receiver architecture according to one example embodiment of the invention. To illustrate these architectures within the context of a communication channel between two devices, a transmitter from one device (e.g., 102) and a receiver from another device (e.g., 104) associated with a communication link are depicted. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that a transceiver in either device (102, 104) may well comprise a transmitter architecture and a receiver architecture as detailed in FIG. 2, although the scope of the invention is not limited in this regard. It should be appreciated that transmitter and receiver architectures of greater or lesser complexity that nonetheless implement the innovative transmit diversity and/or space-frequency interleaving described herein are anticipated by the scope and spirit of the claimed invention. According to one example embodiment, a transmitter architecture 200 is depicted comprising one or more of a serial to parallel transform 210, a (transmit) diversity agent 212, one or more inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT) element(s) 214, a cyclic prefix, or guard interval, insertion element 216 coupled with one or more antenna(e) 220A . . . M through an associated one or more radio frequency (RF) elements 218, although the invention is not limited in this regard. According to one embodiment, transmitter architecture 200 may be implemented within transceiver 108 and/or 116. Although depicted as a number of separate functional elements, those skilled in the art will appreciate that one or more elements of transmitter architecture 200 may well be combined into a multi-functional element, and conversely functional elements may be split into multiple functional elements without deviating from the invention. As used herein, serial-to-parallel (S/P) transform 210 receives information (e.g., bits, bytes, frames, symbols, etc.) from a host device (or, an application executing thereon, e.g., email, audio, video, etc.) for processing and subsequent transmission via the communication channel 106. According to one embodiment, the received information is in the form of quadrature amplitude modulated (QAM) symbols (i.e., wherein each symbol represents two bits, bi and bj). According to one embodiment, serial-to-parallel transform 210 takes the information and generates a number of parallel substreams of the information, which are passed to one or instances of diversity agent 212. Although depicted as a separate functional element, serial to parallel transform 210 may well be included within the diversity agent 212, or other element of the transmitter 200. According to one embodiment, diversity agent 212 selectively introduces an element of transmit diversity into the information streams received from the S/P transform 210. In particular, according to one example embodiment, the informational content is selectively mapped to one or more antenna(e) and OFDM tones. According to one example implementation, if content received from the host device at diversity agent 212 is not in the form of QAM symbols, diversity agent may perform pre-coding to map the received information to QAM symbols, although the invention is not limited in this regard. Indeed, diversity agent may well introduce transmit diversity to any linear combination of input symbols. In any case, diversity agent 212 takes the input (e.g., QAM symbols) and repetitively disperses them (bits, symbols, etc.) across Mt transmit antennas, and a number (N) of OFDM tones for each of a plurality of Rayleigh fading channel taps (L), although the invention is not limited in this regard. By selectively dispersing the content in this manner, full order diversity (Mt Mr L, where Mr is the number of receive antennae) may be achieved. An example method for introducing transmit diversity is presented below with reference to FIG. 3, and a graphical illustration of symbols processed in accordance with an example transmit diversity mechanism is provided in FIG. 5. In accordance with another aspect of the invention, diversity agent 212 may well include the resources to implement a space-frequency interleaving (SFI) mechanism. In this regard, diversity agent 212 may well include one or more of an antenna multiplexing element, a tone interleaving element, a QAM interleaving element, a QAM mapping element and a cyclic tone shifting element, although the invention is not limited in this regard. According to one embodiment, diversity agent 212 may treat adjacent coded bits as one symbol, and spreads this information across space and frequency, e.g., using the transmit diversity repetition scheme introduced above. According to one embodiment, the content received from S/P transform 210 is first interleaved across at least a subset of transmit antenna(e) Mt, and then across a number of OFDM tones for each of a plurality of the Rayleigh fading channel taps (L), although the invention is not limited in this regard. Indeed, these functional elements need not necessarily be applied in the order described above. Moreover, the amount of cyclic tone shift may well be modified to any value between zero (0) and the number data tones (Nds), and there may be a cyclic shift across antennas instead of, or in addition to the shift across tones. An example method for implementing the space-frequency interleaving is developed more fully below, with reference to FIG. 4, and a graphical representation of SFI is presented with reference to FIG. 6. In either case, content from the transmit diversity agent 212 is passed to one or more inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT) element(s) 214. According to one embodiment, an inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) element(s), although the invention is not limited in this regard. According to one embodiment, the number of IDFT elements 214 is commensurate with the number of transmit antenna(e), i.e., transmit radio frequency (RF) chains. In this regard, IDFT element(s) 214 may receive a plurality (Z) of encoded substreams from the diversity agent 212, and converts the content from a frequency domain representation to a time domain representation of the content, although the invention is not limited in this regard. The time domain content from the IDFT element(s) 214 is passed to CPI element(s) 216. According to one embodiment, CPI 216 may introduce a cyclical prefix, or a guard interval in the signal, before it is passed to a radio frequency (RF) front-end 218 for amplification, filtering and subsequent transmission via an associated one or more antenna(e) 220A . . . M. To extract content processed by a transmitter architecture 200, above, an example receiver architecture 250 is introduced. As shown, an RF front-end 254 receives a plurality of signals impinging on one or more receive antennae 240A . . . N. For ease of explanation and description going forward, in accordance with one example embodiment, the number (N) of receive antenna(e) is equal to Mr. According to one embodiment, each receive antenna has a dedicated receive chain, where the number of receive front-end elements 254, CPR elements 256 and FFT elements are commensurate with the number (N) of receive antenna(e) (e.g., Mr). The RF front end 254 may pass at least a subset of the received signal(s) to a cyclic prefix removal element(s) 256, although the invention is not limited in this regard. According to one embodiment, CPR 256 removes any cyclic prefix or guard interval that may have been introduced during transmit processing of the received signal(s). The content from CPR 256 is then provided to an associated one or more of fast Fourier transform (FFT) element(s) 258. According to one embodiment, FFT elements 258 transform the received signals from an associated receive chain from the time domain to the frequency domain, for subsequent demultiplexing and decoding of a representation of the content embedded within the received transmission. Thus, a plurality of frequency domain representations of the received signal(s) are presented to receive diversity agent 260. According to one aspect of the present invention, receive diversity agent 260 may perform a complementary function to that performed by transmit diversity agent 212. In this regard, receive diversity agent 260 may perform the complement to the transmit diversity and/or space frequency interleaving introduced above. In the case of transmit diversity, receive diversity agent 260 may demap the QAM symbols, prior to QAM demodulation and parallel to serial conversion 262 to extract a representation (Iâ\u0080²) of the content encoded within the received signal(s). In the case of SFI, receive diversity agent 260 performs deinterleaving and decoding, before providing the output content to the parallel to serial converter 262 which generates the representation (Iâ\u0080²) of the content encoded within the received signal(s). According to one embodiment, diversity agent 260 may well implement a minimum mean square error (MMSE) spatial demapper followed by soft Viterbi decoding, although the invention is not limited in this regard. Although depicted as a number of functional blocks, those skilled in the art will appreciate that one or more of the foregoing elements may well be implemented in hardware, software, firmware, or any combination thereof. Moreover, although not explicitly denoted, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that one or more elements such as, e.g., diversity agent 212, 260 may well receive control input from baseband and/or MAC processing elements (e.g., 112, 114). According to one embodiment, diversity agents 212, 260 may well implement one or more of transmit diversity and space-frequency interleaving, and communicate which MIMO-OFDM scheme is being used through an exchange of channel state information. In this regard, diversity agent 212, 260 and the transmit diversity/SFI techniques associated therewith, may be adapted according to observed channel delay spread and transmit or receive antenna correlation information (i.e., channel state information). Example Diversity Agent Operation Having briefly introduced an example network environment and diversity agent architecture, above, a discussion of each of the MIMO-OFDM techniques introduced herein will now be developed more fully with reference to FIGS. 3-7. For ease of description and understanding, the development of these techniques will be presented in flow-chart form with continued reference, where appropriate, to example elements in FIGS. 1 and 2, although the invention is not limited in this regard. Turning to FIG. 3, a flow chart of an example method 300 for implementing transmit diversity is disclosed, according to one example embodiment. As shown, the method begins with block 302, wherein the diversity agent 212 receives content for processing. According to one example embodiment, the received content is a plurality of substreams of information received from a serial to parallel transform, although the invention is not limited in this regard. According to one embodiment, the received content is in the form of complex symbols that are linear or nonlinear combinations of input QAM symbols. According to one embodiment, diversity agent 212 may receive the content from a QAM modulator, wherein the received content is in the form of QAM symbols, although the invention is not limited in this regard. According to another embodiment, diversity agent 212 receives uncoded information stream(s) of bits, and converts the content into QAM symbols. In block 304, diversity agent 212 cyclically distributes the QAM symbols across one or more antennae and one or more OFDM tones. According to one embodiment, diversity agent 212 captures spatial diversity through the development of MtÃ\u0097N/L blocks of QAM symbols (where N is the number of OFDM tones, and L is the number of Rayleigh fading channel taps), where the symbols applied to each antenna are offset by a cyclical shift. By repeating these frequency blocks L times across the number of OFDM tones, diversity agent 212 introduces an element of frequency diversity into the channel as well. According to one example embodiment, the number of frequency blocks may be adaptively modified according to multipath conditions in the channel. In this regard, a larger delay spread among frequency blocks may be employed by diversity agent 212 when there is high delay spread (L), and fewer blocks may be used for lower delay spread. Moreover, when there is a risk of horizontal wraparound of symbols, wherein the same symbol is transmitted on the same tone, or a very close tone, on a different antenna, diversity agent 212 may well increase or decrease the dispersion to remove this wraparound condition, as appropriate. A graphical illustration of the transmit diversity blocks are presented with reference to FIG. 5. In block 306, the blocks generated by diversity agent 212 are provided to the remainder of the transmit processing chain (e.g., IDFT 214, et seq.) to enable the transmitter to complete channel processing on the distributed content for transmission via the one or more antenna(e) and OFDM tones. Turning to FIG. 4, a flow chart of an example method 400 for implementing space-frequency interleaving (SFI) is introduced, according to one embodiment of the invention. As shown, the technique begins in block 402, where diversity agent 212 receives encoded content. As above, the encoded content may be received, e.g., from forward error correcting (FEC) encoder, a convolutional encoder, a Reed Solomon encoder, and LDPC encoder, a trellis encoder, a turbo coder a Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH) encoder, etc., which may be an element of diversity agent 212, although the invention is not limited in this regard. According to one implementation, diversity agent 212 may assume a sliding window memory such as that provided by a convolutional encoder, although the invention is not limited in this respect. Indeed, for other codes, diversity agent 212 may rearrange/interleave the input so as to be correlated in a sliding window fashion. In general, the output codeword from any code may be treated as a QAM symbol x1, per the transmit diversity aspect described above, and constituent codeword bits may then be spread using the space-frequency interleaving techniques described herein. Diversity agent 212 may then perform antenna multiplexing on the received encoded information. According to one embodiment, adjacent bits of the received content are first mapped to the Mt antennas. For example, assume the total number of bits=Mt*NCBPS, where NCBPS is the number of coded and punctured bits mapped to forty-eight (48) tones of an OFDM symbol (as used, e.g., in accordance with the IEEE Std. 802.11a (1999) specification, the disclosure of which is expressly incorporated herein by reference for all purposes), although the invention is not limited in this regard. The bits indexed by m:Mt:Mt*NCBPS are mapped to the mth antenna. In block 404, diversity agent 212 may interleave the resulting groups of NCBPS bits on each antenna. According to one embodiment, diversity agent 212 may implement this interleaving in accordance with the 802.11a interleaver, which consists of two elements: tone interleaving, and QAM interleaving (see, e.g., IEEE Std. 802.11a-1999, Part 11: Wireless LAN Medium Access Control (MAC) and Physical Layer (PHY) specifications, incorporated herein for all purposes). According to one example embodiment, diversity agent 212 may ensure that adjacent coded bits are mapped onto nonadjacent subcarriers to perform the tone interleaving. According to one embodiment, the interleaver depth determines how many tones separate adjacent coded bits. In general, this separation should be equal to the coherence bandwidth of the channel, e.g., N/L (where N=DFT size, and L=the length of the channel response in time), although the invention is not limited in this respect. In this regard, the interleaver depth is proportional to the length of the channel impulse in time (L). As used herein, according to one embodiment, interleaver depth may be defined as the separation between bits on adjacent tones in each frequency block. For example, if there are 1:48 input bits to be mapped to 48 tones with a depth of 16 (i.e., per 802.11a interleaver), where the bits are mapped to tones 1:48 column-by-column, bits 1, 17, 33 and 2 are mapped to tones 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. More particularly, the mapping would look like: Â 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748Â If we change the depth to 12, we get the following mapping, where bits 1, 13, 25, 37 and 2 are mapped to tones 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 respectively: Â 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748Â According to one example embodiment, diversity agent 212 may adapt the interleaver depth to the observed value of L. Depending on perceived multipath conditions, a high L will result in a large interleaver depth, and vice versa. According to one embodiment, diversity agent 212 may set the interleaver depth based on a worst case channel response condition, e.g., where L=worst case delay spread=length of the cyclic prefix of an OFDM symbol (e.g., 16 in an 802.11a compliant system). Thus, for arbitrary values of N (e.g., 96 or 108 when multiple 802.11a channels are bonded together to provide high throughput), a key design criterion that determines performance contemplated by the diversity agent 212 is the separation of adjacent coded bits as a function of the channel's coherence bandwidth. If the channel bandwidth increases as in channel bonding without affecting inter-tone spacing, the coherence bandwidth will not change (over the same set of multipath channels). If a larger DFT size is taken within the same channel bandwidth, diversity agent 212 may change the tone spacing such that adjacent coded bits are separated accordingly by a proportionally larger number of tones. To perform QAM interleaving, diversity agent 212 may ensure that adjacent coded bits are mapped alternately onto less and more significant bits of the constellation and, as such, long runs of low reliability (LSB) bits are avoided. According to one example embodiment, diversity agent 212 performs the tone and QAM interleaving in accordance with the following mathematical descriptions, respectively: i=(NCBPS/16)(k mod 16)+floor(k/16)â\u0080\u0083â\u0080\u0083[1] where k=0, 1, . . . , NCBPS-1; and the function floor denotes the largest integer not exceeding the parameter. j=sÃ\u0097floor(i/s)+(i+NCBPSâ\u0088\u0092floor(16Ã\u0097i/NCBPS))mod sâ\u0080\u0083â\u0080\u0083[2] where the value of s is determined by the number of coded bits per subcarrier, NBPSC, according to s=max(NBPSC/2,1). According to one embodiment, a diversity agent 260 in a receiver may employ a deinterleaver which performs the inverse relation defined by the above two permutations, although the invention is not limited in this regard. In block 406, diversity agent 212 may map the interleaved content to QAM symbols. According to one embodiment, diversity agent 212 may include a bit-to-QAM mapper, wherein multiple bits are mapped to the QAM symbols. According to one example embodiment, the OFDM subcarriers are modulated using BPSK, QPSK, 16-QAM, 64-QAM, 128-QAM or 256-QAM, depending on the coding rate to be employed, but the scope of the invention is not limited in this regard. According to one embodiment, the encoded and interleaved binary serial input data may be divided into groups of NBPSC (e.g., 1, 2, 4 or 6) bits and converted into complex numbers representing QAM constellation points. The conversion may be performed according to Gray coded constellation mappings, although the invention is not limited in this respect. In block 408, diversity agent 212 introduces a cyclic shift to the resultant QAM symbols on each antenna with respect to the other antenna(e). According to one embodiment, as introduced above, diversity agent 212 shifts the symbols destined for the mth antenna by mâ\u0088\u00921 tones vis-Ã -vis the 1st antenna. As used herein, the cyclic tone shift introduced by diversity agent may well be greater than 1. Indeed, according to one embodiment, the cyclic tone shift introduced by diversity agent 212 is adaptive based, at least in part, spatial correlationâ\u0080\u0094the more correlated the fading on different antennas, the greater the tone shift from antenna to antenna. In certain implementations, e.g., where the number of transmit antennas (Mt) is high, diversity agent may shift by more than one tone from antenna to antenna to avoid wrap around and ensure good performance. In this regard, according to one embodiment, diversity agent 212 may repeat each bit Mt times, and then perform the SFI technique introduced herein on the larger coded sequence. For example, if the original coded bit sequence is [b1, b2, b3, b4] and there are two transmit antennas (Mt=2), diversity agent 212 may expand the received bit sequence to [b1 b1 b2 b2 b3 b3 b4 b4]. It should be appreciated, from the disclosure herein, that there may be other ways to expand each the coded sequence rather than simple repetition, e.g., by taking into account the resulting multidimensional space-frequency constellations, etc. The space-frequency interleaved blocks are then processed for transmission via one or more antenna(e) and OFDM tones, as introduced above. An example graphical illustration of the space-frequency interleaved blocks generated by diversity agent 212 is provided with reference to FIG. 6, below. Although not particular detailed, those skilled in the art will appreciate from the discussion above, that a receive diversity agent 260 may implement selectively implement either of the foregoing methods in a complementary (e.g., reverse) order to demap, or deinterleave, respectively, content received on signals processed in accordance with the above transmit diversity or space-frequency interleaving techniques. For example, the deinterleaving technique may comprise one or more of cyclically shifting the tones, QAM to bit mapping, deinterleaving, and antenna demultiplexing, although the invention is not limited in this regard. Turning to FIG. 5, a graphical illustration of an example transmit diversity blocks generated in accordance with an embodiment of the invention is presented. In accordance with the example embodiment of FIG. 5, a diversity block of MtÃ\u0097N/L is used. In this case, diversity agent 212 generates an L number 2Ã\u0097N/L matrices of QAM symbols. The technique illustrated in FIG. 5 is extensible to cover situations of Mt>2 by, e.g., incrementing the cyclic delay on each additional transmit antenna according to (Mtâ\u0088\u00921) on successive antennae. It should be appreciated that the space frequency codeword in FIG. 5 is from a Viterbi decoder that decodes across tones while taking into account the repetition of symbols across L blocks, although the invention is not limited in this regard. Turning to FIG. 6 a graphical illustration of an example space-frequency interleaving blocks generated in accordance with an embodiment of the invention is illustrated. As above, for ease of illustration and not limitation, the SFI blocks depicted correspond to an embodiment wherein Mt=2, but is extensible to implementations of Mt>2 in accordance with the techniques described above. FIG. 7 presents a graphical illustration evidencing the performance characteristics associated with various mapping techniques (i.e., single input, single output (1Ã\u00971 SISO), spatial multiplexing (where bits are interleaved across tones, but not antennae), and space-frequency interleaving (SFI)). According to the illustrated embodiment, FIG. 7 graphically illustrates the performance (e.g., measured in bit error rate (BER) and packet error rate (PER) over Es/No) for a 54 Mbps/antenna. As shown, the SFI technique exhibits a modest gain of about one decibel (1 dB) in signal to noise ratio (SNR) performance relative to conventional (simpler) techniques for a receiver consisting of an MMSE spatial demapper and a soft Viterbi decoder, but should be larger for more sophisticated receivers. Although depicted or described as comprising a number of functional elements, those skilled in the art will appreciate, based on the discussion herein, that alternate embodiments of the diversity agent 212 are anticipated within the scope and spirit of the invention. According to one example embodiment, a diversity agent that omits the antenna multiplexing and cyclic tone shift features is anticipated. In accordance with this example embodiment, diversity agent may map blocks of contiguous bits to each of at least a subset of antenna(e), and then perform 802.11a tone and QAM interleaving, and bit-to-QAM mapping described above, although the invention is not limited in this regard. A diversity agent that performs the inverse operations is also anticipated. FIG. 8 depicts a graphical illustration of a performance comparison of SFI vs. spatial multiplexing for a lower data rate of 6 Mbps per transmit antenna. As shown, the performance improvement introduced by SFI is more pronounced at lower data rates. Thus, it should be appreciated from the discussion herein that certain advantages of the proposed technique may be even more pronounced in realistic channels with impairments such as antenna gain imbalance, I/Q mismatch etc. Alternate Embodiment(s) FIG. 9 illustrates a block diagram of an example storage medium comprising content which, when invoked, may cause an accessing machine to implement one or more aspects of the diversity agent 212, 260 and/or associated methods 300, 400. In this regard, storage medium 900 includes content 902 (e.g., instructions, data, or any combination thereof) which, when executed, causes an accessing appliance to implement one or more aspects of diversity agent 212, 260, described above. The machine-readable (storage) medium 900 may include, but is not limited to, floppy diskettes, optical disks, CD-ROMs, and magneto-optical disks, ROMs, RAMs, EPROMs, EEPROMs, magnet or optical cards, flash memory, or other type of media/machine-readable medium suitable for storing electronic instructions. Moreover, the present invention may also be downloaded as a computer program product, wherein the program may be transferred from a remote computer to a requesting computer by way of data signals embodied in a carrier wave or other propagation medium via a communication link (e.g., a modem, radio or network connection). FIG. 10 is a flow chart of an example method for interleaving in a multicarrier wireless communication channel, according to embodiments of the invention. In element 1002, a stream of encoded content is received via a plurality of substreams for each of a number of transmit chains. In element 1004, coded bits are multiplexed to form a symbol for transmission via the plurality of substreams. In element 1006, the coded bits of the symbol are interleaved over the plurality of substreams. In element 1008, the coded bits are mapped to constellation points. In element 1010, the constellation points are converted to time domain content by IDFT. In element 1012, a number of transmit chains are formed. In element 1014, a cyclic shift is applied to each transmit chain. In the description above, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without some of these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form. Embodiments of the present invention may be used in a variety of applications. Although the present invention is not limited in this respect, the circuits disclosed herein may be used in microcontrollers, general-purpose microprocessors, Digital Signal Processors (DSPs), Reduced Instruction-Set Computing (RISC), Complex Instruction-Set Computing (CISC), among other electronic components. However, it should be understood that the scope of the present invention is not limited to these examples. Embodiments of the present invention may also be included in integrated circuit blocks referred to as core memory, cache memory, or other types of memory that store electronic instructions to be executed by the microprocessor or store data that may be used in arithmetic operations. In general, an embodiment using multistage domino logic in accordance with the claimed subject matter may provide a benefit to microprocessors, and in particular, may be incorporated into an address decoder for a memory device.

Thus, laptop computers, cellular radiotelephone communication systems, two-way radio communication systems, one-way pagers, two-way pagers, personal communication systems (PCS), personal digital assistants (PDA's), cameras and other products are intended to be included within the scope of the present invention. The present invention includes various operations.

Alternatively, the operations may be performed by a combination of hardware and software. Moreover, although the invention has been described in the context of a computing appliance, those skilled in the art will appreciate that such functionality may well be embodied in any of number of alternate embodiments such as, for example, integrated within a communication appliance (e.g., a cellular telephone). Many of the methods are described in their most basic form but operations can be added to or deleted from any of the methods and information can be added or subtracted from any of the described messages without departing from the basic scope of the present invention. Any number of variations of the inventive concept are anticipated within the scope and spirit of the present invention.

                    "Description": "BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a combustion apparatus for burning a liquid fuel. Description of Related Art Some combustion apparatuses known in the art are of the type as disclosed in Patent Laying-Open Gazette No. 10-227453. A fuel spraying nozzle incorporated in this apparatus operates to blow a fuel mist to be burnt continuously. This nozzle is of the so-called return type that has an internal return path such that a portion of the fuel supplied from a fuel tank will flow back toward the tank through the internal return path and a return channel provided out of the nozzle. FIG. 4 is a flow diagram showing the flow of fuel in the related art combustion apparatus that includes the return type nozzle. A fuel spraying nozzle 205 built in this apparatus 201 has a spray mouth for jetting a fuel mist. A fuel channel (or â\u0080\u009ca fuel canalâ\u0080\u009d) 209 connected to the nozzle 205 is composed of a feed channel (or â\u0080\u009ca feed canalâ\u0080\u009d) 210 reaching the spray mouth and a return channel (or â\u0080\u009ca return canalâ\u0080\u009d) 211 leading back therefrom to an upstream region of said channel. The feed channel 210 starting from a fuel tank 214 so as to terminate at an inlet of the spraying nozzle 205 does include electromagnetic valves 212 and 213 and an electromagnetic pump 215 that are arranged in series along the feed channel. On the other hand, the return channel 211 connected to a returning side of the nozzle 205 does include a check valve 216 and a proportional control valve 217, that are likewise arranged in series. A downstream end of the return channel 211 merges into the feed channel 210, at a junction intervening between the electromagnetic valve 212 and the electromagnetic pump 215. The proportional control valve 217 disposed in the return channel 211 is the so-called â\u0080\u009cball typeâ\u0080\u009d valve that cannot absolutely close this channel 211. Therefore, the one electromagnetic valve 212 is interposed between the junction and the fuel tank 214 so as to avoid any excessive or undesired flow of fuel from or towards this tank. FIG. 5 shows the structure of proportional control valve 217 employed in the related art combustion apparatus 201. This valve has an internal fuel passage 221 formed in a casing 220 and extending between a fuel inlet end 222 and a fuel outlet end 223, with the inlet end 222 leading to the check valve 216. A valve seat 225 is formed at an intermediate point in the internal passage 221, and a spherical valve body 226 rests on this seat 225. A plunger 227 in contact with the valve body 226 is surrounded by an electromagnetic coil 228. With this coil being turned on with an electric current, it will make a stroke along the axis of casing so as to move the valve body 226 up and down. As the plunger 227 displaces the valve body 226, the cross-sectional area of internal passage 221 will vary to change the flow rate of fuel advancing from the inlet end 222 to outlet end 223. A current regulator not shown but varying the intensity of electric power applied to the proportional control valve 217 will serve to control the fuel flow rate through the return channel. The fuel stream effluent from the tank 214 will continuously be compressed in the electromagnetic pump 215, before entering the spraying nozzle 205. The thus compressed fuel stream of a high pressure will reach the spray mouth that is located at a distal end of the spraying nozzle 205, so that a noticeable portion of such a fuel stream is blown outwards to form a mist. The remainder of said fuel stream will flow back from this nozzle 205, through the check valve 216 and into the inlet end 222 of proportional control valve 217. The remainder having entered this valve 217 through its inlet end 222 is delivered to an upstream region of the feed channel, at a flow rate determined by the intensity of current being applied to said coil 228. Gradual change or certain fluctuation in the temperature of the proportional control valve 217 has been observed in the related art combustion apparatus 201 during its operation. Such a change or fluctuation as being caused by the change in ambient temperature and/or the like will in turn change the temperature of coil 228 installed in the casing 220. Electric resistance of the coil 228 will vary in response to the change in its temperature, thereby rendering unstable the current intensity applied to the coil 228. Consequently, the flow rate at which the remainder of fuel stream flows back through the return channel will become unreliable. It has been somewhat difficult for the related art apparatus 201 to precisely regulate the spraying rate of fuel, failing to stabilize the condition of combustion state. Such an unstable combustion in the related art apparatus does mean that the amount of a fuel sprayed out of said nozzle would not be burnt completely. Incomplete combustion will result in the discharge of a non-burnt fraction, bringing about a poorer efficiency of energy. In addition, an unnegligible amount of toxic gasses such as carbon monoxide is likely to be discharged to the outside, and an undesirable accumulation of soot will take place inside the apparatus. Thus, the problem of environmental pollution has been inherent in the related art combustion apparatuses, not only rendering them likely to become out of order. Further, the proportional control valve 217 incapable of absolutely close the channel in the related art apparatuses has necessitated the electromagnetic valve 212 to prevent a portion of the fuel fed back from escaping into or out of the tank 214. Such an extra valve has made complicated the related art apparatuses, raising manufacture cost and running cost thereof. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An object of the present invention made in view of the problems and drawbacks mentioned above is therefore to provide an advanced combustion apparatus that is simplified in structure, but is nevertheless possible to accurately regulate the sprayed rate of a fuel to ensure complete combustion. In order to achieve this object, an aspect of a combustion apparatus provided herein comprises a spraying means for spraying a fuel, a feed channel (otherwise known as â\u0080\u009ca feed canalâ\u0080\u009d) for feeding the fuel to the spraying means, and a compressing means disposed in the feed channel so as to compress the fuel flowing towards the spraying means. The spraying means may be a return type nozzle, i.e., a nozzle having a spray mouth, an internal feed path and an internal return path. The combustion apparatus has to comprise further a return channel (otherwise known as â\u0080\u009ca return canalâ\u0080\u009d) connected to the spraying means so as to extend back to a junction where the return channel merges into the feed channel on an upstream side of the compressing means, such that a portion of the fuel once delivered to the spraying means through the feed channel will be allowed to flow back through the internal return path and the return channel into the junction. Still further, the apparatus has to comprise an intermittently operating valve disposed in the return channel so as to be closed and opened intermittently or periodically. A valve body of the intermittently operating valve is to be driven to intermittently or periodically close or open the return channel, for the purpose of changing or varying a flow rate of the fuel. Instead of operating the proportional control valve to directly change the degree itself to which it is opened, the present apparatus can now be controlled to regulate an overall period in which this valve must be opened per unit time, or to regulate a frequency at which it must repeat to open. Such a mode of adjusting the spraying rate of fuel will not be adversely affected by any change in ambient temperature or the like, thus avoiding any fluctuation or variation in the spraying rate that would otherwise make it difficult to ensure stable combustion. ON-OFF motions of the valve body of the intermittently operating valve will be effective to change a fuel flow rate through the return channel, thereby adjusting another flow rate of the fuel to be sprayed. The amount of returning fuel that will flow back during each period of the opened state of valve body is not affected by any change in ambient temperature or the temperature of this valve, but does stand almost constant. Accurate amount of fuel can now be sprayed and burnt to ensure complete combustion at an improved efficiency of energy, supplying any desired amount of heat. Stable combustion now afforded herein will minimize the amount of toxic gases such as carbon monoxide and the amount of soot likely to be produced during a combustion process. The apparatus is favorable from a viewpoint of protecting environment from pollution and also protecting the apparatus itself from any damage. The intermittently operating valve may comprise a throttling valve body that will also close and open the return channel to regulate the flow rate of fuel. Also in this case, an accurate amount of fuel can be sprayed and burnt to ensure complete combustion at an improved efficiency of energy, without being affected by any change in ambient temperature but supplying any desired amount of heat. The intermittently operating valve may comprise an actuator, a drive for driving the actuator and a valve body movable in unison with the actuator. So long as the drive remains off not receiving any electric current, the valve body stands closing the return channel, but it will be moved by the actuator so as to open the channel when the drive is electrically activated. In this case, the valve body of intermittently operating valve will not change its opened degree in response to a change in electric current, but open or close the channel fully depending on whether the actuator is electrically energized or not. Any change in ambient temperature will not adversely affect the accuracy of spraying rate. Accurate amount of fuel can now be sprayed to stabilize the condition of combustion, without involving any surplus or deficiency in the fuel flow rate, and affording an improved efficiency of energy to supply any desired amount of heat. Such a stable combustion will remarkably diminish the amount of carbon monoxide and soot. The intermittently operating valve may be an injector valve comprising a throttling valve body that will also close and open the return channel to regulate the flow rate of fuel. The â\u0080\u009cinjector valveâ\u0080\u009d employed in this case will rapidly repeat to move the valve body so as to open and close the return passage within a very short period of time. Such an â\u0080\u009cinjector valveâ\u0080\u009d may be composed of an actuator, an electromagnetic coil for driving the actuator and a valve body movable in unison with the actuator. The valve body will open the channel when the electromagnetic coil is electrically energized. The ON-OFF motions of the valve body of the injector valve will be effective to change a fuel flow rate through the return channel, thereby adjusting another flow rate of the fuel to be sprayed. The amount of returning fuel that will flow back during each period of the opened state of valve body is not affected by any change in ambient temperature or the temperature of this valve, but does stand almost constant. Thus, an accurate amount of fuel can now be sprayed and burnt to ensure complete combustion at an improved efficiency of energy, supplying any desired amount of heat. Stable combustion now afforded herein will minimize the amount of toxic gases such as carbon monoxide and the amount of soot likely to be produced during a combustion process. The apparatus is favorable from a viewpoint of protecting environment from pollution and also protecting the apparatus itself from any damage. However, very rapid, sharp and frequent motions of the intermittently operating valve for regulating the fuel flow rate may be prone to cause vibration, more or less and strong or weak. This valve is connected to the feed and return channels, directly or indirectly, so that such a vibration produced by the valve will possibly be transmitted through these channels to the spraying means, adversely affecting the state of combustion. Taking into account such a possible problem, at least one of the feed and return channels connected to the spraying means has at least one bend located between its ends. Preferably each of the channels bends angularly several times. The channels may each curve several times or may each have at least one corrugated or spiral portion. Even if any vibration is generated by the valve intermittently operating and connected to those channels to regulate the fuel flow rate, the vibration will be attenuated by and in the at least one bend. Such a vibration not transmitted to any other part of this combustion apparatus will not give rise to any incomplete combustion or any noise, thus assuring stable operation of the apparatus. The compressing means may be an electro-magnetic pump driven with an alternating current from a power source. The apparatus may further comprise a combustion chamber with increased diameter in a direction towards downstream of the sprayed mist of fuel. The diameter may increase stepwise or may be tapered to increase towards the downstream. The liquid fuel will be jetted from the pointed spraying means in a flared pattern gradually increasing its diameter as the sprayed mist advances away from said means. There may be some undesirable hypothetical cases wherein some portions of the jetted mist stick to the wall of a combustion chamber and/or the internal temperature thereof is considerably low, so that many mist particles would tend to aggregate not to be burnt smoothly. For example, a parallelepiped space including some dead zones that would not be heated enough to combustion of the fuel mist is not recommended as the combustion chamber. Further, the chamber must not have any wall portions allowing those mist particles to adhere thereto, so that some portion of the liquid fuel should not be lost without being burnt. In view of these possible problems, the combustion chamber proposed herein has diameter that is increased towards the downstream zone in harmony with the shape of a sprayed mist stream. This structure will be useful to completely burn the fuel jetted from the nozzle, without causing any portion of the fuel to stick to the wall of combustion chamber. A clearance appearing during combustion and between the periphery of flame formed herein and the inner wall surface of he combustion chamber flaring as above is so small that combustion heat will be spread uniformly throughout the interior of said chamber. There will be no significant variance in temperature within said interior, whereby all the portions of a liquid fuel ejected in various directions will be burnt completely, without suffering from the problem of aggregation. The apparatus may further comprise a combustion chamber with increased diameter in a direction towards downstream of the sprayed mist of fuel. The chamber has a peripheral wall that is perforated to have many small air holes keeping the chamber's interior in fluid communication with the chamber's exterior. Also in this case, the combustion chamber flares towards the down-stream zone so that the jetted fuel will completely be burnt, without any portion thereof sticking to the wall of combustion chamber. A clearance appearing during combustion and between the periphery of flame formed herein and the inner wall surface of combustion chamber flaring as above is so small that no aggregation of fuel particles will take place. In addition, the small holes formed in and through the peripheral wall of the combustion chamber do serve to positively take in the ambient fresh air. This air will be intermixed well with the fuel mist or flame within the chamber, thereby facilitating complete combustion. Also in order to achieve the object mentioned above, another aspect of a combustion apparatus provided herein comprises, a spraying means for spraying a fuel, a feed channel for feeding the fuel to the spraying means, and a compressing means disposed in the feed channel so as to compress the fuel flowing towards the spraying means. The spraying means may be a return type nozzle, i.e., a nozzle having a spray mouth, an internal feed path and an internal return path. The apparatus may further comprise a return channel connected to the spraying means so as to extend back to a junction where the return channel merges into the feed channel on an upstream side of the compressing means, such that a portion of the fuel once delivered to the spraying means through the feed channel will be allowed to flow back through the return channel into the junction. Still further, the apparatus may comprise an intermittently operating valve disposed in the return channel so as to close and open the return channel intermittently or periodically to thereby regulate a flow rate of fuel, in addition to a feed channel checking means disposed in the feed channel and on a downstream side of said compressing means. The checking means will normally prevent the fuel from flowing backwards but will be opened to allow the fuel to flow forwardly towards the spraying means, when a pressure at a predetermined level acts on this checking means. A valve body of the intermittently operating valve is to be driven to intermittently or periodically close or open the channel, for the purpose of changing or varying a flow rate of the fuel. The present apparatus can now be controlled to regulate an overall period in which this valve must be opened per unit time, or to regulate a frequency at which it must repeat to open. Such a mode of adjusting the spraying rate of fuel will not be adversely affected by any disturbance such as change in ambient temperature, thus avoiding any fluctuation or variation in the spraying rate that would other-wise make it difficult to ensure complete combustion. The intermittently opening valve employed herein is capable of perfectly stopping the back flow of fuel (towards the spraying means) in the return channel, so that return flow can now be adjusted highly accurately, thus adequately regulating the fuel spraying rate. Further, the feed channel checking means disposed downstreamly of the compressing means will normally prevent the fuel from flowing forwards, until opened due to a given pressure which the compressing means generates and applies to this checking means. Thus, both the feed and return channels will be closed properly and temporarily to prevent leakage of fuel out of this system. Instead of operating the proportional control valve to directly change an opened cross-sectional area, the present apparatus can now be controlled to regulate the fuel flow rate by intermittently or periodically opening the valve in the return channel. Such a mode of adjusting the spraying rate of fuel will not be adversely affected by any change in ambient temperature or the like, thus enabling the spraying of an desired accurate amount of fuel to be combusted. Thus, the sprayed fuel will now be burnt completely to improve energy efficiency as compared with the related art apparatuses. Proper adjustment of the spraying rate of fuel will enable a precise control of the ratio of amount of fuel to the amount of air intermixed there-with, thus affording stable combustion of fuel. Stable combustion will in turn minimize the amount of toxic gases such as carbon nonoxide and the amount of soot likely to be produced during a combustion process. The apparatus is favorable from a viewpoint of protecting environment from pollution and also protecting the apparatus itself from any damage. The feed channel checking means is normally closed but capable of opening due to a predetermined pressure that is higher than a hydrostatic pressure head of the fuel then present in the fuel tank that is connected to the feed channel. Thus, such a hydrostatic head lower than the predetermined pressure is insufficient to open the normally closed checking means. This means that the checking means is useful to prevent leakage of fuel, because in inoperative state of the apparatus the spraying means will not receive any amount of fuel. If and when the fuel has to be fed from the tank and sprayed, the compressing means will operate to produce the predetermined pressure or a higher pressure to open the checking valve and to feed the fuel to the spraying means. The apparatus may further comprise a return channel checking means disposed in the return channel but upstreamly of the intermittently operating valve (thus between this valve and the spraying means). The checking means will normally allow the fuel to flow towards the valve, while preventing it from flowing in a reversed direction. The return channel checking means cooperates with the intermittently operating valve so as to more surely close the return channel against such a reversed flow of fuel. Fuel flow through the return channel will be more accurately controlled, thanks to this structure. The apparatus may further comprise a feed channel closing means disposed in the feed channel and between the compressing means and the feed channel checking means. The feed channel closing means cooperates with the feed channel checking means so as to more surely close the feed channel against such a forward but undesired flow of fuel, thereby more surely preventing leakage of fuel. The apparatus may further comprise an accumulator disposed in the return channel and between the return channel checking means and the intermittently operating valve. In this case, the return channel will be closed tightly and temporarily between the return channel checking means and the intermittently operating valve, thus tending to raise the fuel pressure in this region. In this event, an extra-ordinarily strong stress would be imparted to these means and valve and impair their durability. However, the accumulator employed herein will buffer such an extreme pressure so as to protect them from breakage or damage, thereby enhancing their durability. It is a further advantage of the apparatus in this case that the accumulator will precisely control and stabilize the spraying rate of fuel thus stabilizing the flame, facilitating complete and efficient combustion and also reducing combustion noise. The intermittently operating valve may be an injector valve comprising a throttling valve body that will also close and open the return channel to regulate the flow rate of fuel. This valve body is to be driven to intermittently or periodically close or open the return channel, for the purpose of changing or varying a flow rate of the fuel. Instead of operating the proportional control valve to directly change the degree itself to which it is opened, the frequency at which the valve body repeats to close and open the passage will now be adjusted to control the fuel flow rate. Such a mode of control will not be adversely affected by any change in ambient temperature or the like, thus avoiding any fluctuation or variation in the spraying rate and combustion rate that would otherwise make it difficult to ensure stable combustion. Stable combustion now afforded herein will minimize the amount of toxic gases such as carbon monoxide and the amount of soot likely to be produced during a combustion process. The apparatus is favorable from a viewpoint of protecting environment from pollution and also protecting the apparatus itself from any damage. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1 is a schematic front elevation of a combustion apparatus provided in an embodiment of the present invention; FIG. 2 is a diagram showing a fuel pipe line that is constructed in the apparatus shown in FIG. 1; FIG. 3 is a cross section of an injector valve incorporated in the apparatus of FIG. 1; FIG. 4 is a diagram showing a fuel pipe line in the related art combustion apparatus; and FIG. 5 is a cross section of a proportional control valve employed in the related art apparatus. THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS In FIG. 1, a combustion apparatus of a first embodiment is generally denoted at the reference numeral 2. This apparatus 2 comprises a nozzle block 8 having an end opened in a hollow shell 7, and a combustion chamber 10 is attached to the end of nozzle block 8. A fan or blower 11 mounted on the shell 7 will operate to feed the ambient air into the combustion chamber 10. A fuel spraying nozzle (as the spraying means) 12 is installed in the nozzle block 8 in order to spray a fuel towards and into the combustion chamber 10. The spraying nozzle 12 has a spray mouth (not shown) for jetting the fuel. An internal feed path (not shown) and an internal return path (not shown) leading to or starting back from the spray mouth are formed in or for the nozzle 12. Thus, the fuel spraying nozzle 12 will operate to jet a portion of the fuel that is being fed from the outside though the feed canal. The remainder of said fuel will be left unsprayed to subsequently flow back through the return canal. As seen in FIG. 2, a fuel pipe line 13 connects the fuel spraying nozzle 12 to a fuel tank 15 holding therein a mass of the fuel The pipe line 13 consists mainly of a fuel feed canal (i.e., a feed channel) 16 and a return canal (i.e., a return channel) 17, such that the former canal communicates with an internal feed path formed in the nozzle 12 and the latter canal 17 communicates with an internal return path also formed in the spraying nozzle 12. As shown in FIG. 1, pipes 5 forming those feed and return canals 16 and 17 extend outwardly of the shell 7 so as to lead to an injector valve 25 and an electromagnetic pump 18, that are detailed below. Those pipes 5 also connected to the nozzle 12 are each bent several times at substantially right angles between the nozzle and the valve 25 or pump 18. Bends formed thus in said pipes will make same more tenacious on one hand, and will attenuate any vibration being transmitted from said pump 18 or injector valve 25 on the other hand. Thus, such a vibration will scarcely reach the spraying nozzle 12, thereby protecting it from damage. The feed canal 16 combining the nozzle 12 with the fuel tank 15 in series does serve to supply the nozzle with the fuel stored in the tank. Disposed in this canal 16 are the electromagnetic pump 18, an electromagnetic valve 20 and a check valve (as a feed channel checking means) 21. The check valve 21 normally stands closed, and an activation pressure (that is a minimum actuating pressure) for opening this valve is higher than a maximum hydrostatic head of the fuel in tank 15 standing in fluid communication with the feed canal 16. In other words, the hydrostatic pressure caused by the fuel stored in the tank 15 will never exceed the minimum pressure for activating the checking valve 21 to open. For example, in the combustion apparatus 2 of the present embodiment, the fuel tank 15 is disposed higher than the valve 21 by 0.5 meter. The minimum actuating pressure is 0.2 Kgf/cm2 (viz., 2.0Ã\u0097104 Pa) for this valve 21, that is much higher than the hydrostatic head 0.04 Kgf/cm2 (viz., 0.39Ã\u0097104 Pa) for the fuel in tank 15. Thus, the fuel will not flow toward the spraying nozzle 12 unless the pump 18 compresses it. Although the minimum actuating pressure for said valve 21 is selected herein to be high by about 5 times of said hydrostatic head of said fuel, the ratio of the former to the latter may fall within a range from 3 to 5. The fuel tank 15 may alternatively be positioned at any height, from 1.5 m above to 2.0 m below the valve 21, thus making the hydrostatic head not higher than 0.12 Kgf/cm2 (viz., 1.2Ã\u0097104 Pa). As noted above, the normally closed check valve 21 shall not naturally open merely due to hydrostatic head of the fuel in tank 15. There may be a possibility that the electromagnetic valve 20 would unintentionally open, though fuel feed to the nozzle 12 had to be interrupted for the combustion apparatus 2 then standing inoperative. Even in such an accident, the check valve 21 will surely stop the fuel not to leak out towards a downstream canal region. If and when the fuel from the tank 15 has to be sprayed, it will be compressed by the pump 18 and enabled to pass through the valve 21 and flow to the nozzle 12. A portion of the fuel fed to the nozzle 12 will be left there unburnt, and such a remainder will flow back towards the tank 15 through the return canal 17. A downstream end (near the tank 15) of the return canal 17 merges into the feed canal 16 at its intermediate point located on the up-stream side of electromagnetic pump 18 (and facing the tank 15). Disposed at another intermediate point of the return canal 17 is a temperature sensor (viz., temperature sensing means) 22 for detecting the temperature of fuel flowing back through this canal. A further check valve (as the return channel checking means) 23 is disposed downstreamly of the sensor 22 so that the fuel can flow towards the tank 15 but is inhibited from flowing in a reversed direction away from this tank. Disposed on the downstream side of the check valve 23 is the injector valve (viz., intermittently operating valve) 25 that will be opened and closed periodically at given time intervals. An accumulator 26 intervening between the injector valve 25 and the further check valve 23 will serve to buffer fluctuation in pressure of the fuel flowing through the return canal 17. The injector valve 25 will operate at an extreme high frequency to be opened and then instantly closed. As shown in FIG. 3, this valve 25 comprises a casing 30, an actuator 31 held therein, an electromagnetic coil 32 for driving the actuator 31, and a valve body 33 movable in unison with the actuator 31. Formed at opposite ends of the casing 30 are a fuel inlet 35 and a fuel outlet 36, with an internal fuel passage 37 extending between them 35 and 36 and through the casing 30. The casing 30 has a terminal 38 leading to the electromagnetic coil 32 so that power supply through this terminal 38 will activate said coil 32. Consequently, the actuator 31 will be energized within the casing 30, thereby simultaneously driving the valve body 33 to open the passage 37 that is a part of the return canal 17. The valve body 33 of the present embodiment thus opens the passage 37 instantly in response to the coil 32 energized with an electric current, and said body 33 will close the passage instantly upon inactivation of said coil 32. The injector valve 25 in such a closed state in response to inactivated coil 32 will have its valve body 33 very tightly shutting the fuel passage 37 to absolutely close the return canal 17. The terminal 38 is connected to a controlling means 40 that is incorporated to regulate the spraying rate of fuel jetting from the nozzle 12 and also to regulate the operation of fan or blower 11. The controlling means 40 is designed to periodically or intermittently activate the coil 32 to displace the valve body 33 to open and to close the passage, thus controlling the flow rate of fuel being sprayed from the nozzle 12. For example, the control means 40 may perform a duty ratio control with respect to one-cycle time â\u0080\u0098Lâ\u0080\u0099 in which the valve body 33 opens and closes the passage one time and at the same time with respect to an overall time â\u0080\u0098tâ\u0080\u0099 in which the valve is open during the one cycle time â\u0080\u0098Lâ\u0080\u0099. In detail, duty ratio â\u0080\u0098râ\u0080\u0099 may be the ratio of â\u0080\u0098Lâ\u0080\u0099 to â\u0080\u0098tâ\u0080\u0099, in which time â\u0080\u0098tâ\u0080\u0099 a pulse current will be applied to the coil 32 for the nozzle 12. Flow rate of the fuel flowing back through the return canal 17 is controlled accurately in this manner so as to indirectly but precisely adjust the flow rate of fuel actually jetted from the spraying nozzle 12. It is noted here that the electromagnetic pump 18 always imparts a constant discharge pressure to a fuel flow that is being urged by this pump towards the nozzle 12 in this apparatus 2. Any change in the flow rate of the fuel being discharged from said pump will never affect the constant discharge pressure. Thus, the valve body 33 of injector valve 25 is always subjected to a constant pressure. The valve body 33 will open the passage in response to a pulse current input to the terminal 38. A portion of fuel is thus blown back from the outlet of injector valve 25 at a constant return pressure, that is ensured by virtue of the constant discharge pressure of said pump. The amount of fuel having returned back through the injector valve 25 in a given period of time does depend on an overall time in which the valve body 33 has been open during this period. Thus a constant amount of fuel per unit time flows through the valve at a constant pressure when the pulse current applied to the terminal 38 is â\u0080\u009cONâ\u0080\u009d. Thus, the amount of fuel that will have passed the injector valve 25 can be regulated by means of the time period in which the valve body 33 will be kept open during this time period. Thus, the flow rate of fuel flowing back into and passing through the return canal 17 will be adjusted to realize a desired flow rate of said fuel to be burnt at the spraying nozzle 12. The duty ratio â\u0080\u0098râ\u0080\u0099 measured in this way may be used in the duty ratio control executed in the controlling means 40. So long as the apparatus is inoperative not to conduct combustion process, the controlling means 40 will interrupt the current to the coil 32, thus tightly closing the injector valve 25. The return canal 17 is thus closed at the two checkpoints, that is, the check valve 23 and injector valve 25. As mentioned above and shown in FIG. 1, the spraying nozzle 12 is installed in the nozzle block 8. This block is a double cylinder composed of an inner cylinder 50 surrounding the nozzle and an outer cylinder 51 en-closing said inner cylinder. The inner cylinder 50 covers the spraying nozzle 12 and an ignition plug 52 for inflammation of the fuel mist jetted from the nozzle. The combustion chamber 10 secured to such a nozzle block 8 is formed integral therewith. An air intake (not shown) disposed beside the inner and outer cylinders 50 and 51 will feed ambient air into the chamber 10 to be consumed in the combustion process. The combustion chamber 10 is of a stepped shape as seen in FIG. 1 such that its first cylinder 53 fixed on the nozzle block 8 continues to a second cylinder 54. The second cylinder 54 has a diameter larger than that of the first one 53, thereby increasing stepwise the diameter of combustion chamber 10 towards its distal end remote from the nozzle 12. The first cylinder 53 continuing from the nozzle block 8 has a perforated peripheral wall to have a multiplicity of air holes 56 arranged all around this cylinder, whereby ambient air will penetrate this cylinder to flow into the combustion cylinder 10. Likewise, the second cylinder 55 continuing from the first one 53 has a perforated peripheral wall to have a multiplicity of further air holes 57 also arranged all around this cylinder, whereby a further amount of ambient air will penetrate this cylinder to flow into the combustion camber 10. The combustion chamber 10 thus increasing diameter towards its distal end is shaped in conformity with configuration of the stream of mist sprayed from nozzle 12. No noticeable quantity of fuel will not adhere to the inner surface of combustion chamber 10, and no remarkable gap will appear between this surface and the periphery of a flame produced during the combustion process. The fuel being sprayed from the nozzle 12 will thus spread evenly throughout the combustion chamber 10, whereby combustion heat will be distributed to the chamber's wall and the interior of chamber also uniformly. Temperature distribution throughout this chamber 10 is now rendered so uniform that almost all the fuel particles sprayed from nozzle 12 will be completely burnt, without suffering from aggregation of them. As noted above, the gap between the combustion chamber wall 10 and the flame is reduced and a sufficient amount of ambient air is introduced into the chamber through the air holes 56 and 57. Thanks to these structural features, the fuel sprayed into and flaming in said chamber is intermixed well with the ambient air so as to ensure complete combustion. As also noted above, both the feed canal 16 to and the return canal from the spraying nozzle 12 are capable of being shut with two valves, that is, valves 20 and 21 or valves 23 and 25. Thus, the fuel tank 15 can be sealed tightly against these canals, whenever so required. An inter-valve zone â\u0080\u0098Aâ\u0080\u0099 present between injector valve 25 and check valve 23 may tend to show a high pressure to injure either of these valves, because of a tightly closing nature of the injector valve 25. However, the accumulator 26 disposed in the return canal 17 and absorbing such a high internal pressure will effectively protect them from damage. The related art fuel pipe line 209 in a combustion apparatus necessitates two or more electromagnetic valves, but they are usually expensive, bulky and cause waste of electric energy. In contrast, the fuel pipe line 13 forming the combustion apparatus 2 of the invention has only one electromagnetic valve 20 installed therein in combination of two check valves 21 and 23 and one injector valve 25. Thus, the present apparatus is rendered more compacted and capable of being manufactured inexpensively and operating with a reduced consumption of electric power, thus resolving all the drawbacks inherent in the related art apparatuses. As the electromagnetic pump in the feed canal 16 discharges fuel in constant pressure, flow rate of fuel supplied to the spraying nozzle is quite constant. The injector valve 25 employed herein and disposed in return canal 17 does cooperate with the single electromagnetic valve 20 of feed canal, in a very preferable manner. The opening and dosing of the former valve 25 is repeated fast and frequently at every instant, with the latter valve 20 constantly discharging the fuel, so that it will be sprayed at any accurate and desired rate from the spraying nozzle 12 into the combustion chamber 10 in a highly stable fashion. Thus, the fuel well mixed with ambient air within this chamber will exactly and efficiently produce a required amount of heat, without giving rise to any material loss of the fuel fed to the nozzle. Stable and complete combustion of fuel in the apparatus 2 will minimize the amount of carbon monoxide or the like toxic gases and soot which incomplete combustion has been producing, thereby diminishing environ-mental pollution and breakdown of apparatus."

                    "Description": "TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a packet data scheduling method. BACKGROUND ART In a mobile communication system, studies have been carried out on efficient scheduling methods which satisfy QoS (Quality of Service) required for applications, determine transmission priority for packets and the traffic amount in consideration of, for example, changes in a propagation path and an interference state, and assign wireless resources accordingly. Among them, application of the GPS (Generalized Processor Sharing) scheduling method (hereinafter abbreviated to â\u0080\u009cGPS methodâ\u0080\u009d) performing scheduling of transmission packets in consideration of both fairness between mobile stations and QoS, to a mobile communication system has been studied (for example, see Non-Patent Document 1) In this GPS method, by assigning weight to mobile stations (flows) in accordance with a total transmission rate setting value and determining an available transmission traffic amount per mobile station (instantaneous transmission rate), it is possible to secure fairness in assigning wireless resources between mobile stations. In the GPS method, on the assumption that the total transmission rate is constant, scheduling is performed by determining a total transmission rate setting value. In other words, in the conventional GPS method, a total transmission rate setting value is set in accordance with a constant total transmission rate known in advance. - Non-Patent Document 1: L. Xu, X. Shen, and J. Mark, â\u0080\u009cDynamic bandwidth allocation with fair scheduling for WCDMA systems,â\u0080\u009d IEEE Wireless Communications, pp. 26-32, April 2002 DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION Problems to be Solved by the Invention However, in a mobile communication system where packets are simultaneously transmitted to a plurality of mobile stations in a wireless environment, since the transmission rate of a subchannel differs for every mobile station using that subchannel, the total transmission rate of the channel changes in accordance with the result of subchannel assignment to the mobile stations. The â\u0080\u009csubchannelâ\u0080\u009d here is equivalent to, for example, a subcarrier in-multicarrier communication such as OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing), and a spreading code that is subjected to multicode-multiplex in CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) communication. For example, upon assignment of subcarriers to mobile stations, in OFDM, in the Max-C/I method whereby subcarriers are assigned, per subcarrier, to the mobile stations having the best channel quality, the following is observed. That is, if the CQI's (Channel Quality Indicator) of mobile stations at a certain point are as shown in FIG. 1, subcarriers 1, 2 and 4 are assigned to mobile station 1, and subcarrier 3 is assigned to mobile station 2, and, therefore, the total transmission rate here is 14 bits/s. Here, assume that channel quality is better as the value of CQI increases, and CQI=1, CQI=2, CQI=3, and CQI=4 correspond to the modulation schemes of BPSK (1 bit), QPSK (2 bits), 8PSK (3 bits) and 16QAM (4 bits), respectively. Also, if the CQI's of mobile stations at a certain point are as shown in FIG. 2, subcarriers 3 and 4 are assigned to mobile station 1 and subcarriers 1 and 2 are assigned to mobile station 2, and, therefore, the total transmission rate changes to 12 bits/s. Thus, in a mobile communication system, the total transmission rate of a channel changes in accordance with the result of subchannel assignment to mobile stations. In the case where the total transmission rate changes as above, there is a problem of a total transmission rate setting value in the GPS method. For example, when the total transmission rate setting value is set at 6000 bits/s, the weighting factor for mobile station 1 is â \u0098 and the weighting factor for mobile station 2 is â \u0095, to maintain both fairness and QoS for mobile stations 1 and 2, it is necessary to maintain the instantaneous transmission rate for mobile station 1 at 4800 bits/s and the instantaneous transmission rate for mobile station 2 at 1200 bits/s at all times. Here, if the present actual total transmission rate is 4000 bits/s, the present actual total transmission rate (4000 bits/s) is less than the total transmission rate setting value (6000 bits/s), and, therefore, it is difficult to maintain both fairness and QoS for mobile stations 1 and 2. In other words, if assignment of subchannels is determined by giving priority to the QoS of one of mobile station 1 or mobile station 2, the QoS of the other station fails and furthermore fairness is lost. In contrast, a method of estimating and setting a total transmission rate setting value to be less than a predicted actual total transmission rate may be possible. For example, a case is considered where the total transmission rate setting value is set at 2000 bits/s when the actual total transmission rate is 4000 bits/s. Similar to above, when the weighting factor for mobile station 1 is â \u0098 and the weighting factor for mobile station 2 is â \u0095, to maintain both fairness and QoS for mobile stations 1 and 2, it is necessary to maintain the instantaneous transmission rate for mobile station 1 at 1600 bits/s and the instantaneous transmission rate for mobile station 2 at 400 bits/s at all times. In this case, the actual total transmission rate (4000 bits/s) is greater than the total transmission rate setting value (2000 bits/s), so that it is possible to satisfy both fairness and QoS for mobile stations 1 and 2. However, there is waste of 2000 bits/s (the actual total transmission rate 4000 bitsâ\u0080\u0094the total transmission rate setting value 2000 bits/s) of channel resources, and consequently channel use efficiency is reduced. Hence, in the GPS method, when the total transmission rate setting value is estimated to be less than the actual total transmission rate and set, it is possible to maintain both fairness between mobile stations and QoS. However, channel use efficiency is reduced, and, as a result, throughput is degraded. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a packet data scheduling method capable of maintaining both QoS and fairness for mobile stations (flows) and improving channel use efficiency. MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEM A scheduling method of the present invention is a packet data scheduling method used in a radio communication apparatus transmitting packet data to a plurality of communicating parties using a plurality of subchannels, the method comprising: a first step of setting a total transmission rate for the plurality of communicating parties; a second step of calculating a traffic amount for each of the plurality of communicating parties in accordance with the total transmission rate and a weighting factor assigned to each of the plurality of communicating parties; a third step of assigning the plurality of subchannels to the plurality of communicating parties in accordance with channel quality up to upper limits of the traffic amounts; a fourth step of calculating a transmission rate for a subchannel that is not assigned to any of the plurality of communicating parties in the third step among the plurality of subchannels; and a fifth step of updating the total transmission rate using the transmission rate calculated in the fourth step, wherein the second step, the third step, the fourth step and the fifth step are performed repeatedly until the number of subchannels that are not assigned to any of the plurality of communicating parities in the third step is equal to or less than a threshold. ADVANTAGES EFFECT OF THE INVENTION According to the scheduling method of the present invention, it is possible to maintain both QoS and fairness for mobile stations (flows) and improve channel use efficiency.

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION FIG. 3 is a flowchart of a scheduling method according to an embodiment of the present invention. A description will be given below with reference to this flowchart. First, in ST (step) 10, a total transmission rate setting value C (initial value) is set according to equation (1). [Equation 1] C=Î²CM, 0<Î²<1â\u0080\u0083â\u0080\u0083(1) where CM is the transmission rate when subchannel assignment is performed using the Max-C/I method, and can be expressed by equation (2). where F(Î\u0093f,n,ek) expresses a transmission rate at which a mobile station can satisfy PER (Packet Error Rate)=ek at reception SINR=Î\u0093k,n. Also, B shows a set of mobile stations (flows) for which packets are stored in that slot period. Further, the value of F(Î\u0093k,n,ek) depends upon MCS (Modulation Coding Scheme). That is, when adaptive modulation is performed on subchannels, the most efficient modulation scheme is selected so as to satisfy PER=e for reception SINR=Î\u0093. When reception SINR=Î\u0093 and PER=e are as shown in FIG. 4, 8PSK is selected as a modulation scheme. Here, a function f(Î\u0093,e) is expressed by the number of bits corresponding to the selected modulation scheme. One bit, two bits, three bits, and four bits can be transmitted per symbol in BPSK, QPSK, 8PSK, 16QAM, respectively. Therefore, when 8PSK is selected as a modulation scheme, it follows that f(Î\u0093,e) =3 bits. Now, if 100 symbols are transmitted per subcarrier in one second, it follows that F(Î\u0093,e)=100Ã\u0097f(Î\u0093,e)=300 bits/s. Next, in ST20, traffic amount Sk for each of the mobile stations (flows) is calculated according to equation (3) using the GPS method. where Ï\u0086k is the weighting factor assigned to the mobile station (flow), C is the total transmission rate estimation value set in ST10, and T is the length of a time slot. Further, Î·k is the traffic amount for mobile station k (flow k) in one slot period. Ï\u0086k is given by equation (4). In equation (4), Rk is a required transmission rate of mobile station k (flow k). Next, in ST30, packets for mobile stations (flows) are assigned to the subchannels. This subchannel assignment is performed by the Max-C/I method. Next, in ST40, the actual transmission rate (effective transmission rate) Câ\u0080² is calculated according to equation (5). Here, rk represents the actual transmission rate for a mobile station (flow). Next, in ST50, whether or not the number of remaining subchannels to which packets are not assigned in ST30, is equal to or less than a threshold is determined. Then, when the number of remaining subchannels is not equal to or less than the threshold (â\u0080\u009cNOâ\u0080\u009d in ST50), the transmission rate Î\u0094C for these remaining subchannels is calculated in ST60, and C is reset to Câ\u0080²+Î\u0094C in ST 70. In other words, C is updated using Î\u0094C. Thereafter, the processing returns to ST20 and the processing of ST20 through ST70 is repeated until the number of remaining subchannels is equal to or less than the threshold in ST50. Then, when the number of remaining subchannels is determined to be equal to or less than the threshold in ST50 (â\u0080\u009cYESâ\u0080\u009d in ST50), assignment of the remaining subchannels is performed in ST80. Next, more specifically, the scheduling method of the flowchart shown in FIG. 3 will be described. In the description below, OFDM will be described as an example. Accordingly, a subcarrier is equivalent to a subchannel. Also, assume that the number of mobile stations (the number of flows) is K=2 and the number of subcarriers is N =8. Further, assume that the length of a time slot is T=1 sec, and 100 symbols are transmitted in one second. Still further, assume that the threshold for the number of remaining subcarriers is Îµ=1. Also, if the required transmission rate for mobile station 1 (flow 1) is R1=1200 bits/s and the required transmission rate for mobile station 2 (flow 2) is R2=400 bits/s, the weighting factor Ï\u00861 for mobile station 1 and the weighting factor Ï\u00862 for mobile station 2 are as shown in equation (6). Now, assume that the CQI's of mobile stations and subcarriers are as shown in FIG. 5. The relationships between CQI's, modulation schemes, and the numbers of bits are as shown in FIG. 6. First, in ST10, a total transmission rate setting value C (initial value) is set for mobile station 1 and mobile station 2. Accordingly, subcarrier assignment is performed according to the Max-C/I method. As a result, subcarriers 2, 4 and 6 are assigned to mobile station 1, and subcarriers 1, 3, 5, 7 and 8 are assigned to mobile station 2 (FIG. 7). Accordingly, CM in above equation (1) is as shown in equation (7). [Equation 7] CM=(2+4+2+2+2+4+2+2)Ã\u0097100 bits/s=2000 bits/sâ\u0080\u0083â\u0080\u0083(7) Here, if Î²=0.6, the total transmission rate setting value C (initial value) eventually becomes as shown in equation (8). [Equation 8] C=Î²Â·CM=0.6Ã\u00972000=1200 bits/sâ\u0080\u0083â\u0080\u0083(8) Next, in ST 20, traffic amounts S1 and S2 for the mobile stations (flows) are calculated using C=1200 bits/s set in ST10 according to above equation (3). As a result, traffic amounts S1 and S2 are as shown in equation (9). Next, in ST30, packets for the mobile stations (flows) are assigned to subcarriers up to upper limits of traffic amounts S1 and S2 by the Max-C/I method. As a result, subcarrier assignment is as shown in FIG. 8. Next, in ST40, the effective transmission rate Câ\u0080² is calculated from the result of assignment in ST30. Here, the effective transmission rate Câ\u0080² is as shown in equation (10). [Equation 10] Câ\u0080²=900+300=1200 bits/sâ\u0080\u0083â\u0080\u0083(10) Next, in ST50, whether or not the number of remaining subcarriers is equal to or less than a threshold is determined. According to FIG. 8, the number of remaining subcarriers Nu, to which packets are not assigned, is â\u0080\u009c3â\u0080\u009d and the threshold Îµ is â\u0080\u009c1.â\u0080\u009d Accordingly, â\u0080\u009cNOâ\u0080\u009d is determined in ST50, and the processing proceeds to ST60. In ST60, transmission rate Î\u0094C for the remaining subcarriers 5, 7 and 8 to which the packets are not assigned in ST30, is calculated. In above FIG. 7, subcarriers 5, 7 and 8 are assigned to mobile station 2 and all have CQI of â\u0080\u009c2,â\u0080\u009d so that the transmission rate Î\u0094C is as shown in equation (11). [Equation 11] Î\u0094C=Î²Â·(2+2+2)Ã\u0097100=0.6Ã\u0097600=360 bits/sâ\u0080\u0083â\u0080\u0083(11) Then, in ST70, C is reset to Câ\u0080²+Î\u0094C. As a result, C is reset as shown in equation (12). The processing again returns to ST20. [Equation 12] C=C+Î\u0094C=1200+360=1560â\u0089\u00881600 bits/sâ\u0080\u0083â\u0080\u0083(12) Next, in ST20, traffic amounts S1 and S2 for the mobile stations (flows) are calculated again using C=1600 bits/s reset in ST70 according to above equation (3). As a result, traffic amounts S1 and S2 are as shown in equation (13). Next, in ST30, packets for the mobile stations (flows) are assigned to the subcarriers up to upper limits of traffic amounts S1 and S2 by the Max-C/I method. As a result, the subcarrier assignment is as shown in FIG. 9. That is, packets for mobile station 2 are assigned to subcarriers 5 and 7. Next, in ST40, the effective transmission rate Câ\u0080² is calculated according to the result of assignment in ST30. Here, the effective transmission rate Câ\u0080² is as shown in equation (14). [Equation 14] Câ\u0080²=1200+(200+200)=1600 bits/sâ\u0080\u0083â\u0080\u0083(14) Next, in ST50, whether or not the number of remaining subcarriers is equal to or less than a threshold is determined. According to FIG. 9, the number of remaining subcarriers Nu, to which packets are not assigned, is now â\u0080\u009c1â\u0080\u009d and the threshold Îµ is â\u0080\u009c1.â\u0080\u009d Accordingly, â\u0080\u009cYESâ\u0080\u009d is determined in ST50, and the processing proceeds to ST60. Then, in ST80, the remaining subcarrier 8 is assigned to mobile station 2. Although the total transmission rate setting value C (initial value) is set according to equation (1) in this embodiment, C may also be set as below. For example, C for slot i may be set at the transmission rate of the packet correctly received in the previous slot (i-1). Further, setting according to equation (15) or equation (16) below is also possible. Moreover, in CDMA scheme communication, setting according to equation (17) below is also possible. In equation (17), gk is the number of codes assigned to mobile station k (flow k), ak is ak=1/SINRk, and G is the maximum number of multiplex codes. The setting methods described here can be used when the transmission rate Î\u0094C for remaining subcarriers to which packets are not assigned is calculated in the above-mentioned ST60. Further, it is also possible to simplify the scheduling processing by assuming the processing in ST70 as â\u0080\u009cC=C+Î\u0094Câ\u0080\u009d and omitting the processing in ST40 in the flowchart of above FIG. 3. A radio transmission apparatus that performs the above scheduling method will now be described. FIG. 10 is a block diagram showing a radio transmission apparatus according to an embodiment of the present invention. In FIG. 10, buffers 101-1 to 101-K buffer packets for mobile stations 1 to K, respectively. Scheduler 102 performs scheduling according to the flowchart in the above FIG. 3. Under control by scheduler 102, queuing section 103 inputs the packets buffered in buffers 101-1 to K to adaptive modulation section 104 in accordance with traffic amount Sk. Adaptive modulation section 104 modulates the input packets by the modulation scheme designated by scheduler 102. The modulation scheme in scheduler 102 is determined in accordance with CQI. Under control by scheduler 102, assignment section 105 assigns the packets for mobile stations 1 to K to subcarriers 1 to N as described above. OFDM modulation section 106 then performs inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) on subcarriers 1 to N, and generates OFDM signals. The OFDM signals are subjected to predetermined radio processing in radio transmission section 107, and then transmitted to mobile stations 1 to K from antenna 108. Although the radio transmission apparatus of the OFDM scheme has been described here, it is also possible to implement the scheduling method of this embodiment with a radio transmission apparatus of the CDMA scheme. In this case, a subchannel in the above scheduling method is equivalent to a spreading code that is subjected to multicode-multiplex. Thus, according to this embodiment, the total transmission rate setting value in the GPS method is found from the result of the subchannel assignment by Max-C/I method, so that the total transmission setting value is nearly identical to the actual transmission rate. As a result, it is possible to perform subchannel assignment where fairness between mobile stations is maintained. Further, by repeating the GPS method considering fairness and the Max-C/I method considering channel use efficiency according to the above-mentioned flowchart of FIG. 3, it is possible to maintain fairness between mobile stations and improve channel use efficiency. In addition, each of functional blocks employed in the description of the above-mentioned embodiment may typically be implemented as an LSI constituted by an integrated circuit. These are may be individual chips or partially or totally contained on a single chip. â\u0080\u009cLSIâ\u0080\u009d is adopted here but this may also be referred to as an â\u0080\u009cICâ\u0080\u009d, â\u0080\u009csystem LSIâ\u0080\u009d, â\u0080\u009csuper LSIâ\u0080\u009d, or â\u0080\u009cultra LSIâ\u0080\u009d depending on differing extents of integration. Further, the method of integrating circuits is not limited to the LSI's, and implementation using dedicated circuitry or general purpose processor is also possible. After LSI manufacture, utilization of FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) or a reconfigurable processor where connections or settings of circuit cells within an LSI can be reconfigured is also possible. Furthermore, if integrated circuit technology comes out to replace LSI's as a result of the advancement of semiconductor technology or derivative other technology, it is naturally also possible to carry out function block integration using this technology. Application in biotechnology is also possible.

                    "Description": "FIELD OF THE INVENTION This disclosure teaches techniques related to continuously preparing product particles with particle size in the order of a nanometer from a solution containing a particle-forming precursor. BACKGROUND Nanoparticles are used in many applications, including, as stable monochromatic fluorescence particles, magnetic particles, etc. Current research also includes efforts aimed at utilizing nanoparticles as building blocks of a wavelength-tunable light-emitting diode, monoparticle semiconductor, super-concentration magnetic storage medium and such other devices. Because of remarkable technical advances in various related fields in recent times, nanoparticles are being used in an increasingly wide range of application. Therefore, the demand for nanoparticles have increased rapidly. Production of nanoparticles of metal such as gold, platinum and nickel, and compound such as titanium oxide, zinc oxide, cadmium selenide and zinc sulfide have been reported. Various techniques of preparing nanoparticles, such as a homogeneous precipitation method, a hydrothermal crystallization method and an organometallic synthesis method are conventionally known. In order to obtain a desirable reduced size of the nanoparticle using a production process, in many cases, a number of nuclei are required to be formed. This also means that the concentration of a precursor, during the nucleus formation, needs to be sharply increased. This process inevitably leads to heterogeneity in the precursor concentration and increased temperature in a reaction system. This heterogeneity has a great affection on the particle size distribution of nanoparticles to be obtained. This adverse affect will be significant as the production facility is scaled up. On the other hand, it is difficult to prepare nanoparticles on a mass production basis. To overcome this problem, a continuous preparation method has been conventionally attempted. However, these attempts have not succeeded in providing an effective technique. Heretofore, to obtain nanoparticles with a desired particle size range the following technique has been used. Adequate raw materials are selected along with associated surfactants and other additions. A reaction temperature and reaction time is adjusted to control the rate of reaction of the raw materials or intermediate products and the rate of formation of the end product. However, even if the reaction could be actually completed in a short period of time, the reaction rate is intentionally reduced due to the difficulty of controlling the reaction temperature and reaction time with a high degree of accuracy. SUMMARY The disclosed teachings are aimed at overcoming the disadvantages in the conventional preparation methods of nanoparticles, and continuously preparing nanoparticles with a narrow particle size distribution while facilitating a highly accurate control of the reaction temperature and reaction time. The disclosed teachings provide a method of preparing nanoparticles each having a particle size of 1 nm to 1 Î¼m, preferably in the range of 1 to 20 nm, comprising continuously supplying a solution containing a particle-forming precursor (hereinafter referred to as â\u0080\u009cparticle-forming precursor solutionâ\u0080\u009d) into a micro channel which has a diameter of 1 Î¼m to 1 mm and is disposed in a heating zone, simultaneously heating the solution rapidly up to a reaction initiation temperature to cause a reaction in the solution, and then rapidly cooling the solution. Another aspect of the disclosed teachings is a an apparatus for producing a nanoparticle, the apparatus comprising a micro channel with a diameter of 1 Î¼m to 1 mm, with at least one source of input for a solution containing a nanoparticle-forming precursor. A heating zone is provided for heating the micro channel, where solution can be heated rapidly to a reaction initiation temperature. A collection vessel is provided for collecting a reaction product. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1 is a schematic diagram showing one example of an apparatus suitable for implementing a method of the present invention; FIG. 2 is a schematic diagram showing another example of an apparatus suitable for implementing a method of the present invention; FIG. 3 is a transmission electron microscopic picture of gold colloid nanoparticles obtained in Example 1; and FIG. 4 is a transmission electron microscopic picture of gold colloid nanoparticles obtained in Example 2. DETAILED DESCRIPTION With reference to the drawings, the disclosed techniques are described in detail. FIG. 1 schematically shows an example of an apparatus embodying the disclosed techniques. This apparatus uses two different kinds of particle-forming precursor solutions A and B. The two kinds of particle-forming precursor solutions A and B are simultaneously supplied to a micro channel such as a capillary tube 3 by their corresponding syringe pumps 1 and 2, and mixed together in the micro channel. The resulting mixture is transferred to a heating zone such as an oil bath 4, and rapidly heated up to a reaction initiation temperature in the heating zone 4. After reaction in the heating zone in the mixture, the reacted mixture is discharged from the heating zone 4 to the atmosphere, and rapidly cooled down. Finally, the reacted mixture is collected in a vessel 5. When the mixture passes through the heating zone 5, the product is precipitated in the form of nanoparticles. If the two particle-forming precursor solutions do not react at room temperature but react only at a high temperature, these precursor solutions may be mixed together in advance. In such a case, the mixture is then supplied to the micro channel, and heated in the heating zone to generate nanoparticles. This causes turbulence and facilitates the mixing and the subsequent reaction that results in the creation of nanoparticles. The micro channel 3 should be designed to have a diameter in the range of 1 Î¼m to 1 mm. The reduced diameter of the micro channel reduces the ratio of the volume to surface area of the precursor solutions (or the mixed precursor solution) passing through the micro channel. Such a reduced ratio ensures that more of the solution can sufficiently receive the heat from an outside heating source or the heating zone in the quickest possible time. The solution also can more quickly respond to the changes in temperature of the outside heating source. This results in a rapid and highly accurate temperature control of the solution. In addition, the concentration of the solution can be controlled with a high degree of accuracy by reducing the width of the micro channel to provide a reduced diffusion length. If the diameter of the micro channel is greater than 1 mm, the effectiveness of the apparatus deteriorates. In such a case, back mixing will occur at the front end due to turbulent flows. This makes it difficult to maintain evenly, the residence time of the solutions in the heating zone, thereby making it difficult to provide a narrow size distribution of the nanoparticles that are produced. If the diameter of the micro channel is less than 1 Î¼m, it becomes very difficult to handle the micro channel. This also increases the pressure loss in the apparatus, deteriorating the production efficiency. The material of the capillary tube may include glass, metal, alloy or plastic such as polyolefin, polyvinyl chloride, polyamide, polyester or fluororesin. While the example in FIG. 1 uses a capillary tube as the micro channel, alternately the micro channel may be provided by forming a layer and then cutting a groove having a width of 1 nm to 1 Î¼m on the surface of the layer. The layer could be made of, for example, metal oxides such as silica, alumina or titania. It could also be made of a heat-resistant plastic such as fluorinated resin, on a heat-resistant substrate, for example, made of metal or alloy, Another example having such a structure is schematically shown in FIG. 2. Specifically, a heat-resistant layer is formed on a substrate 6, and a groove 3â\u0080² serving as the micro channel is cut on the substrate 6. The mixture of the particle-forming precursor solutions A and B supplied to the groove 3â\u0080² is heated as it passed through the heating zone 4. The heating zone could be a heat plate. The solutions react in the heating zone and the product mixture is collected in the vessel 5. While the examples in FIGS. 1 and 2 use two separate syringe pumps as material feeders, the particle-forming precursor solutions A and B may be supplied by using a single common feeder. A heating device for the heating zone 4 may be composed of a bath with a heating medium such as oil as described above. Any other suitable conventional heating device such as a heat plate, an infrared heater, and a high-frequency heater may also be used. According to the disclosed technique, the particle-forming precursor solution is preferably heated up to its reaction initiation temperature at a high heating rate of 5Â° C./sec or more in the heating zone. Such a rapid heating allows heat energy from outside to be transferred to the particle-forming precursor solution approximately without time lay. Thus, the reaction is formed in the solution very quickly to create a number of nuclei and consequently grow a number of particles so as to form nanoparticles having a small particle size. If the heating rate is less than 5Â° C./sec, the number of nuclei to be created will be reduced. This causes the particles to gradually grow around the respective nuclei at a lower speed. Thus, the particle size of the particles to be formed will be increased, and desired nanoparticles with a particle diameter 1 nm to 1 Î¼um become harder to be obtained. Besides, in such a case, since the particle-forming precursor solution is gradually heated from its outer region toward its inner region, the reaction initiation timing and the particle growth time will be varied in the respective regions of the solution. Therefore, in such a case, the particle-size distribution cannot be controlled within a desired narrow range. It is technically difficult to increase the heating rate in an unrestricted manner. Further, if an excessive number of nuclei are created, it will be practically impossible to supply the precursor at a concentration required for growing and forming particles corresponding to the nuclei. From this point of view, the heating rate is preferably set in a reasonable average range of 5Â° C./sec to 10,000Â° C./sec or more. The nanoparticles formed in the heating zone in this way should be rapidly cooled immediately after the reacted solution exits the heating zone. The cooling rate is preferably set at 5Â° C./sec or more. A cooling rate of less than 5Â°C./sec will cause increased unevenness of the cooling, the reaction termination timing and the particle growth time in the respective regions of the reacted solution, resulting in undesirably expanded particle-size distribution. The cooling may be done by means of natural cooling, air-cooling, oil-cooling or the like. Any conventional cooling device may be used. Further, the particle-forming precursor solution may be locally heated and cooled by a small-size heating element or Peltier element disposed around the micro channel. In the disclosed technique the reaction is not restricted to any specific mode. Any suitable mode may be selected. According to one mode, one or more reactants in the form of solution are heated or mixed together to form a powdery solid. In another mode, insoluble compound particles are precipitated from plural kinds (e.g. two kinds) of soluble compounds. In yet another mode, one kind of soluble compound is pyrolytically decomposed to form powdery compound particles. Among these modes, one that provides a higher reaction rate or having a particle precipitation-rate to be significantly influenced by the reaction temperature or the concentration of chemical species is particularly preferable. Such a reaction may include a reaction in which a reducer is reacted with a soluble metal compound solution to precipitate various kinds of metal particles. It may also include: a reaction in which carbonic acid is reacted with a calcium hydroxide solution to precipitate calcium carbonate particles, a reaction in which a sulfuric acid solution is reacted with a calcium chloride solution to precipitate calcium sulfide particles, a reaction in which a hydrogen sulfide solution is reacted with a cadmium chloride solution to precipitate cadmium sulfide particles, a reaction in which tetraalkoxysilane is thermally decomposed to precipitate silicon oxide particles, and a reaction in which a water-soluble selenium compound solution is reacted with a water-soluble cadmium compound solution to precipitate cadmium selenide particles. The materials forming the nanoparticles using such a reaction may include: metal such as gold, silver, palladium, cobalt or nickel; metalloids such as silicon or germanium; metal or metalloid oxide such as zinc oxide, silicon oxide or germanium oxide; metal chalcogenide compound such as cadmium selenide, cadmium sulfide or zinc sulfide; and organic compounds such as organic complex compound or organic pigment. The solvent of the particle-forming precursor solution used in the method of the present invention may be selected from: water; water-miscible organic solvent such as methyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol, acetone, dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide or dimethyl sulfoxide; and water-immiscible organic solvent such as octane, cyclohexane, benzene, xylene, diethyl ether or acetic ether, depending on the type of precursor and the mode of reaction to be used. In this case, an excessively high concentration of the precursor in the particle-forming precursor solution will increase the viscosity of the solution. This leads to a heterogeneous reaction having an adverse affect on the smooth formation of nanoparticles. If the precursor concentration is excessively low, the reaction rate will be reduced, and more time will be required for forming nanoparticles. Thus, the precursor concentration is typically set in the range of 0.001 to 5% by mass, preferably in the range of 0.01 to 1% by mass. In the disclosed techniques, the particle size of nanoparticles to be formed can be controlled by adjusting the heating temperature and the residence time in the heating zone. In this process, the reaction temperature may be controlled by using a heating device having a temperature control function. The residence time may be controlled by adjusting the feeding rate of the particle-forming precursor solution or the volume of the micro channel, and introducing a certain gas or liquid into the micro channel to segment the solution. In this manner, the residence-time distribution of the solution can be maintained to be uniform to provide a narrow particle-size distribution. Such a residence time-distribution depends on the flow rate distribution, which in turn arises from the friction between the solution and the inner wall of the micro channel. In this case, the gas to be used may include: inert gas such as nitrogen, argon or helium; oxidant gas such as air or oxygen; and reductant gas such as hydrogen or ammonia. The liquid to be used may include any suitable liquid which is not homogeneously mixed with the particle-forming precursor solution. For example, when the solution is a hydrophilic solution, the liquid may be a hydrophobic solvent such as hexane, cyclohexane or toluene. When the solution is a oleophilic solution, the liquid may be a hydrophilic solvent such as water, methyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol, dimethyl sulfoxide or dimethylformamide. In the disclosed technique, the particle-forming precursor solution may be agitated to provide homogeneous reaction and reduced reaction time in the heating zone, as needed. This agitation may be performed using a micro stirrer, a mixing tube or an ultrasound device. The solution may also be agitated by mixing magnetic particles or magnetic fluid with the particle-forming precursor solution in advance, and applying a magnetic field thereto from outside. In the disclosed techniques, a pump is used to continuously supply the particle-forming precursor solution to the heating zone. The pump is not limited to a specific type, but any suitable small-size pump may be selected. However, it is preferable to select a pump having low pulsations, such as a syringe pump or a non-pulsating pump. In the disclosed techniques, when two kinds of particle-forming precursor solutions are used and reacted with one another in the heating zone, these solutions are preferably selected as a combination capable of forming different phases. These solutions are then made to react with one another along the interface between the different phases in the heating zone to form nanoparticles. In this case, the reaction can be homogeneously caused to provide nanoparticles having a constant particle-size distribution. The entire flow rate and reaction time can be readily controlled by changing the respective flow rates of the phases. According to the disclosed techniques, nanoparticles with a particle size of greater than 1 Î¼m can also be prepared. However, particles having an excessively increased size will sediment under gravity. These sedimented particles clog the micro channel and prevent the continuous operation of the apparatus. Thus, it is desirable to select the reaction conditions such that nanoparticles having a particle size in the range of 1 nm to 1 Î¼m, preferably in the range of 1 to 20 nm are produced. The disclosed techniques are described in more detail in conjunction with Examples, but not limited to these Examples. Example 1 A micro reactor constructed as shown in FIG. 1 was prepared by immersing approximately one-half of the intermediate portion of a glass capillary tube having an inner diameter of 0.5 mm and a length of 1 m, into an oil bath having a volume of 500 ml. A 1 mM-chloroauric acid solution and a 2% by mass of citric acid solution were fed from first and second syringe pumps, respectively, at a feed speed of 0.05 ml/minute, and mixed together before their introduction into the oil bath. Then, the mixture was introduced into the oil bath heated at 200Â° C. in advance, and rapidly heated up to 100Â° C. at a heating rate of 10Â° C./sec to cause a reaction in the mixture. Then, the reacted mixture was naturally cooled under ambient air, and collected in a vessel. In this case, the residence time in the oil bath was 10 minutes, and the cooling rate was 10Â° C./sec. In this manner, gold colloid nanoparticles having an average particle size of 15 nm could be continuously obtained. A transmission electron microscopic picture of the obtained gold colloid nanoparticles is shown in FIG. 3. Example 2 Based on a micro reactor using a hot water bath as a substitute for the oil bath of the micro reactor in Example 1, chloroauric acid was deoxidized by tannic acid and citric acid. More specifically, a 1 mM-chloroauric acid solution and a solution containing 2% by mass of mixture consisting of tannic acid, citric acid and potassium carbonate (mass ratio:5:7:4) were fed from the first and second syringe pumps, respectively, at a feed speed of 0.3 ml/minute, and mixed together. Then, the mixture was rapidly heated up to 60Â° C. in the hot water bath to cause a reaction in the mixture while applying ultrasounds from outside. Then, the reacted mixture was rapidly cooled under ambient air. In this case, the heating rate was 10Â° C./sec, the residence time being 1 minute, and the cooling rate being 10Â° C./sec. In this manner, gold colloid nanoparticles having an average particle size of 8 nm could be continuously obtained. A transmission electron microscopic picture of the obtained gold colloid nanoparticles is shown in FIG. 4. Example 3 This example is based on a micro reactor having the same structure as that in Example 1 except that a single syringe pump was used as a substitute for the two syringe pumps. Further, the capillary tube had an inner diameter of 1 mm and a length of 700 mm. Further, cadmium sulfide particles were prepared through a homogeneous precipitation method. More specifically, 50 mg/liter of cadmium sulfide, 60 mg/liter of thiourea, 500 mg/liter of sodium hexametaphosphate and 30 mg/liter of sodium hydroxide were dissolved in ion-exchange water. Then, the mixture was fed from the syringe pump to the capillary tube in the oil bath heated at 97Â° C. in advance, at a feed speed of 0.5 to 0.25 ml/minute to cause a reaction in the mixture. Then, the reacted mixture was rapidly cooled under ambient air. In this case, both the heating rate and the cooling rate were maintained at a constant value of 5Â° C./sec, but only the residence time was changed between 2 minutes, 5 minutes and 10 minutes. The average particle sizes of gold colloid nanoparticles obtained in the respective conditions were judged from UV-VIS absorption spectrums. The result is shown in Table 1.

Example 4 This example is based on a micro reactor having a structure as shown in FIG. 1, provided with a micro channel composed of a capillary tube having an inner diameter of 0.2 mm and a length of 1.2 mn. A single syringe pump was used. A mixed solution containing 70 g/kg of cadmium stealate, 300 g/kg of trioctylphosphineoxide, 90 g/kg of trioctylphosphineselenide and 280 g/kg of trioctylphosphine was fed at a feed speed of 0.1 to 0.01 ml/minute. The mixture was passed through the oil bath maintained at 275Â° C., and rapidly heated therein to cause a reaction. Then, the reacted mixture was rapidly cooled and then collected. The average particle sizes of gold colloid nanopaiticles were measured and determined from UV-VIS absorption spectrums. In this case, the heating rate was maintained at 3000Â° C./sec, and the cooling rate was maintained at 1000Â° C./sec. The residence time was changed between 0.5 minutes, 5 minutes and 10 minutes.

                    "Description": "CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application is a continuation application of the U.S. Utility patent application Ser. No. 17/898,234 filed on Aug. 29, 2022, which claims the priority of Korean Patent Application No. 10-2022-0079620 filed on Jun. 29, 2022, in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE Technical Field The present disclosure relates to scalable video coding for a machine. Background Art Continuous development of the information and communication industry has led to a worldwide spread of broadcasting services having a high definition (HD) resolution. As a result, users of such services have become accustomed to high-resolution and high-definition images and/or videos, and demand has increased for high picture quality, that is, high-resolution, high-quality video such as ultra high definition (UHD) video. Standardization of coding technology for UHD (4K, 8K, or higher) video data was completed in 2013 through high efficiency video coding (HEVC). HEVC is a next-generation video compression technology that has a higher compression rate and lower complexity than the previous H.264/AVC technology. HEVC is a key technology for effectively compressing the massive amounts of data of HD and UHD video content. HEVC performs block-based encoding like previous compression standards. However, unlike H.264/AVC, there is a difference in that only one profile exists. There are a total of eight core encoding technologies included in HEVC's unique profile, to include technologies for hierarchical coding structure, transformation, quantization, intra prediction coding, inter picture motion prediction, entropy coding, loop filtering, and others. Since adoption of the HEVC video codec in 2013, immersive video and virtual reality services using 4K and 8K video images have expanded, and a versatile video coding (VVC) standard has been developed. VVC, which is called H.266, is a next-generation video codec that aims to improve performance by more than two times compared to HEVC. H.266 (VVC) was developed with the goal of more than twice the efficiency of the previous generation codec, i.e., H.265 (HEVC). VVC was initially developed with 4K or higher resolution in mind, but it was also developed for 16K-level ultra-high-resolution image processing for the purpose of responding to 360-degree images due to the expansion of the VR market. In addition, as the HDR market gradually expands due to the development of display technology, VVC supports not only 10-bit color depth but also 16-bit color depth, and supports 1000 nits, 4000 nits, and 10000 nits of brightness expression. In addition, as it is being developed with the VR market and 360-degree video market in mind, it supports variable frame rates ranging from 0 to 120 FPS. Advancement of Artificial Intelligence Artificial intelligence (AI) is also developing rapidly. AI refers to artificially imitating human intelligence, that is, intelligence capable of performing recognition, classification, inference, prediction, and control/decision making. Due to the development of artificial intelligence technology and the increase in Internet of Things (IOT) devices, it is predicted that traffic between machines will explode, and image analysis that depends on the machine will be widely used.

Hereinafter, the present disclosure will be described in detail by explaining examples of the present disclosure with reference to the accompanying drawings. FIG. 1 schematically shows an example of a video/image coding system. Referring to FIG. 1, a video/image coding system may include a source device and a receive device. The source device may transmit encoded video/image information or data in the form of a file or streaming to the receive device through a digital storage medium or a network. The source device may include a video source, an encoding apparatus, and a transmitter. The receive device may include a receiver, a decoding apparatus, and a renderer. The encoding apparatus may be referred to as a video/image encoder, and the decoding apparatus may be referred to as a video/image decoder. The transmitter may be included in the encoding apparatus. The receiver may be included in the decoding apparatus. The renderer may include a display unit, and the display unit may be configured as a separate device or external component. The video source may acquire a video/image through a process of capturing, synthesizing, or generating a video/image. A video source may include a video/image capture device and/or a video/image generating device. A video/image capture device may include, for example, one or more cameras, a video/image archive containing previously captured video/images, and the like. A video/image generating device may include, for example, a computer, tablet, or smartphone, and may (electronically) generate a video/image. For example, a virtual video/image may be generated through a computer, and the like. In this case, the video/image capturing process may be substituted for the process of generating related data. The encoding apparatus may encode the input video/image. The encoding apparatus may perform a series of procedures such as prediction, transformation, and quantization for compression and coding efficiency. The encoded data (encoded video/image information) may be output in the form of a bitstream. The transmitter may transmit encoded video/image information or data output in the form of a bitstream to the receiver of the receive device in the form of a file or streaming through a digital storage medium or a network. The digital storage medium may include various storage media such as a flash drive, SD card, CD, DVD, Blu-ray disc, HDD, SSD, or the like. The transmitter may include an element for generating a media file through a predetermined file format, and may include an element for transmission through a broadcast/communication network. The receiver may receive/extract the bitstream and transmit it to the decoding apparatus. The decoding apparatus may decode the video/image by performing a series of procedures such as inverse quantization, inverse transformation, and prediction corresponding to the operation of the encoding apparatus. The renderer may render the decoded video/image. The rendered video/image may be displayed through the display unit. FIG. 2 illustrates a configuration of a video/image encoder. Hereinafter, a video encoding apparatus may include an image encoding apparatus. Referring to FIG. 2, the encoding apparatus 10a may be configured to include an image partitioning unit 10a-10, a predictor 10a-20, a residual processor 10a-30, an entropy encoder 10a-40, an adder 10a-50, a filter 10a-60, and a memory 10a-70. The predictor 10a-20 may include an inter predictor 10a-21 and an intra predictor 10a-22. The residual processor 10a-30 may include a transformer 10a-32, a quantizer 10a-33, an dequantizer 10a-34, and an inverse transformer 10a-35. The residual processor 10a-30 may further include a subtractor 10a-31. The adder 10a-50 may be referred to as a reconstructor or a reconstructed block generator. The above-described image partitioning unit 10a-10, predictor 10a-20, residual processor 10a-30, entropy encoder 10a-40, adder 10a-50, and filter 10a-60 may be configured by one or more hardware components (e.g., encoder chipset or processor) according to an embodiment. In addition, the memory 10a-70 may include a decoded picture buffer (DPB), and may be configured by a digital storage medium. The hardware component of the memory 10a-70 may be configured as an internal or external component. The image partitioning unit 10a-10 may divide an input image (or a picture, a frame) input to the encoding apparatus 10a into one or more processors. As an example, the processor may be referred to as a coding unit (CU). In this case, the coding unit may be divided recursively according to a quad-tree binary-tree ternary-tree (QTBTTT) structure from a coding tree unit (CTU) or largest coding unit (LCU). For example, one coding unit may be divided into a plurality of coding units having a lower depth based on a quad tree structure, a binary tree structure, and/or a ternary structure. In this case, for example, a quad tree structure may be applied first and a binary tree structure and/or a ternary structure may be applied later. Alternatively, the binary tree structure may be applied first. A coding procedure according to the present disclosure may be performed based on the final coding unit that is no longer divided. In this case, the maximum coding unit may be directly used as the final coding unit based on coding efficiency according to image characteristics. Alternatively, if necessary, the coding unit may be recursively divided into coding units of a lower depth, so that a coding unit having an optimal size may be used as a final coding unit. Here, the coding procedure may include procedures such as prediction, transformation, and restoration, which will be described later. As another example, the processor may further include a predictor (PU) or a transformer (TU). In this case, the predictor and the transformer may be divided or partitioned from the above-described final coding unit, respectively. The predictor may be a unit of sample prediction, and the transformer may be a unit for deriving a transform coefficient and/or a unit for deriving a residual signal from the transform coefficient. A unit may be used interchangeably with terms such as a block or an area in some cases. In general, an MÃ\u0097N block may represent a set of samples or transform coefficients including M columns and N rows. A sample may generally represent a pixel or a value of a pixel, may represent only a pixel/pixel value of a luma component, or may represent only a pixel/pixel value of a chroma component. A sample may be used as a term corresponding to a picture (or image) as a pixel or a pel. The subtractor 10a-31 may generate a residual signal (a residual block, residual samples, or a residual sample array) by subtracting a predicted signal (a predicted block, predicted samples, or a predicted sample array) output from a predictor 10a-20 from an input video signal (an original block, original samples, or an original sample array), and the generated residual signal is transmitted to the transformer 10a-32. A predictor 10a-20 can perform prediction on a processing target block (hereinafter referred to as a current block) and generate a predicted block including predicted samples with respect to the current block. The predictor 10a-20 can determine whether intra-prediction or inter-prediction is applied to the current block or coding unit (CU). The predictor can generate various types of information about prediction, such as prediction mode information, and transmit the information to an entropy encoder 10a-40. Information about prediction can be encoded in the entropy encoder 10a-40 and output in the form of a bitstream. The intra predictor 10a-22 can predict a current block with reference to samples in a current picture. Referred samples may neighbor the current block or may be separated therefrom according to a prediction mode. In intra-prediction, prediction modes may include a plurality of nondirectional modes and a plurality of directional modes. The nondirectional modes may include a DC mode and a planar mode, for example. The directional modes may include, for example, 33 directional prediction modes or 65 directional prediction modes according to a degree of minuteness of prediction direction. However, this is an example, and a higher or lower number of directional prediction modes may be used depending on the setting. The intra predictor 10a-22 may determine a prediction mode to be applied to the current block using a prediction mode applied to neighbor blocks. The inter predictor 10a-21 can derive a predicted block with respect to the current block on the basis of a reference block (reference sample array) specified by a motion vector on a reference picture. Here, to reduce the quantity of motion information transmitted in an inter-prediction mode, motion information can be predicted in units of blocks, subblocks, or sample on the basis of correlation of motion information between a neighboring block and the current block. The motion information may include a motion vector and a reference picture index. The motion information may further include inter-prediction direction (L0 prediction, L1 prediction, Bi prediction, etc.) information. In the case of inter-prediction, neighboring blocks may include a spatial neighboring block present in a current picture and a temporal neighboring block present in a reference picture. The reference picture including the reference block may be the same as or different from the reference picture including the temporal neighboring block. The temporal neighboring block may be called a collocated reference block or a collocated CU (colCU) and the reference picture including the temporal neighboring block may be called a collocated picture (colPic). For example, the inter predictor 10a-21 may form a motion information candidate list on the basis of neighboring blocks and generate information indicating which candidate is used to derive a motion vector and/or a reference picture index of the current block. Inter-prediction can be performed on the basis of various prediction modes, and in the case of a skip mode and a merge mode, the inter predictor 10a-21 can use motion information of a neighboring block as motion information of the current block. In the case of the skip mode, a residual signal may not be transmitted differently from the merge mode. In the case of a motion vector prediction (MVP) mode, the motion vector of the current block can be indicated by using a motion vector of a neighboring block as a motion vector predictor and signaling a motion vector difference. The predictor 10a-20 may generate a prediction signal based on various prediction methods to be described later. For example, the predictor may apply intra prediction or inter prediction to predict one block, and may simultaneously apply intra prediction and inter prediction. This can be called combined inter and intra prediction (CIIP). In addition, the predictor may perform intra block copy (IBC) to predict the block. IBC may be used for video/video coding of content such as a game, for example, screen content coding (SCC). IBC basically performs prediction within the current picture, but may be performed similarly to inter prediction in that a reference block is derived within the current picture. That is, IBC may use at least one of the inter prediction techniques described in the present disclosure. A predicted signal generated through the inter predictor 10a-21 or the intra predictor 10a-22 can be used to generate a reconstructed signal or a residual signal. The transformer 10a-32 can generate transform coefficients by applying a transform technique to a residual signal. For example, the transform technique may include at least one of DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform), DST (Discrete Sine Transform), GBT (Graph-Based Transform), and CNT (Conditionally Non-linear Transform). Here, GBT refers to transform obtained from a graph representing information on relationship between pixels. CNT refers to transform obtained on the basis of a predicted signal generated using all previously reconstructed pixels. Further, the transform process may be applied to square pixel blocks having the same size or applied to non-square blocks having variable sizes. A quantizer 10a-33 may quantize transform coefficients and transmit the quantized transform coefficients to the entropy encoding unit 10a-40, and the entropy encoding unit 10a-40 may encode a quantized signal (information about the quantized transform coefficients) and output the encoded signal as a bitstream. The information about the quantized transform coefficients may be called residual information. The quantizer 10a-33 may rearrange the quantized transform coefficients in the form of a block into the form of a one-dimensional vector on the basis of a coefficient scan order and may generate information about the quantized transform coefficients on the basis of the quantized transform coefficients in the form of a one-dimensional vector. The entropy encoding unit 10a-40 can execute various encoding methods such as exponential Golomb, context-adaptive variable length coding (CAVLC) and context-adaptive binary arithmetic coding (CABAC), for example. The entropy encoding unit 10a-40 may encode information necessary for video/image reconstruction (e.g., values of syntax elements and the like) along with or separately from the quantized transform coefficients. Encoded information (e.g., video/image information) may be transmitted or stored in the form of a bitstream in network abstraction layer (NAL) unit. The video/image information may further include information about various parameter sets, such as an adaptation parameter set (APS), a picture parameter set (PPS), a sequence parameter set (SPS), or a video parameter set (VPS). In addition, the video/image information may further include general constraint information. Signaling/transmitted information and/or syntax elements described later in the present disclosure may be encoded through the above-described encoding procedure and included in the bitstream. The bitstream may be transmitted through a network or stored in a digital storage medium. Here, the network may include a broadcast network and/or a communication network and the digital storage medium may include various storage media such as a flash drive, SD card, CD, DVD, Blue-ray disc, HDD, or SSD. A transmitter (not shown) which transmits the signal output from the entropy encoding unit 10a-40 and/or a storage (not shown) which stores the signal may be configured as internal/external elements of the encoding apparatus 100, and the transmitter may be included in the entropy encoding unit 10a-40. The quantized transform coefficients output from the quantizer 10a-33 can be used to generate a predicted signal. For example, a residual signal can be reconstructed by applying inverse quantization and inverse transform to the quantized transform coefficients through an dequantizer 10a-34 and an inverse transformer 10a-35 in the loop. An adder 10a-50 can add the reconstructed residual signal to the predicted signal output from the inter predictor 10a-21 or the intra predictor 10a-22 such that a reconstructed signal (reconstructed picture, reconstructed block, or reconstructed sample array) can be generated. When there is no residual with respect to a processing target block as in a case in which the skip mode is applied, a predicted block can be used as a reconstructed block. The adder 10a-50 may also be called a reconstruction unit or a reconstructed block generator. The generated reconstructed signal can be used for intra-prediction of the next processing target block in the current picture or used for inter-prediction of the next picture through filtering which will be described later. Meanwhile, luma mapping with chroma scaling (LMCS) may be applied during picture encoding and/or restoration. The filter 10a-60 may improve subjective/objective image quality by applying filtering to the reconstructed signal. For example, the filter 10a-60 may generate a modified reconstructed picture by applying various filtering methods to the reconstructed picture, and store the modified reconstructed picture into the memory 10a-70, specifically the memory 10a-70 can be stored in the DPB. The various filtering methods may include, for example, deblocking filtering, sample adaptive offset (SAO), an adaptive loop filter, a bilateral filter, and the like. The filter 10a-60 may generate various kinds of filtering-related information and transmit it to the entropy encoding unit 10a-90, as will be described later in the description of each filtering method. The filtering-related information may be encoded by the entropy encoding unit 10a-90 and outputted in the form of a bitstream. The modified reconstructed picture transmitted to the memory 10a-70 may be used as a reference picture in the inter predictor 10a-80. Through this, when inter prediction is applied, the encoding apparatus can avoid prediction mismatch between the encoding apparatus 10a and the decoding apparatus, and can also improve encoding efficiency. The DPB of the memory 10a-70 may store the modified reconstructed picture to be used as a reference picture in the inter predictor 10a-21. The memory 10a-70 may store motion information of a block from which motion information in the current picture is derived (or encoded) and/or motion information of blocks in an already reconstructed picture. The stored motion information may be transmitted to the inter predictors 10a-21 to be used as motion information of a spatial neighboring block or motion information of a temporal neighboring block. The memories 10a-70 may store reconstructed samples of blocks reconstructed in the current picture, and may transmit the reconstructed samples to the intra predictors 10a-22. FIG. 3 illustrates a configuration of a video/image decoder. Referring to FIG. 3, the decoding apparatus 10b may be configured to include an entropy decoder 10b-10, a residual processor 10b-20, a predictor 10b-30, and an adder 10b-40, a filter 10b-50, and a memory 10b-60. The predictor 10b-30 may include an inter predictor 10b-31 and an intra predictor 10b-32. The residual processor 10b-20 may include a dequantizer 10b-21 and an inverse transformer 10b-22. The entropy decoder 10b-10, the residual processor 10b-20, the predictor 10b-30, the adder 10b-40, and the filter 10b-50 may be configured by one hardware component (e.g., a decoder chipset or a processor) according to an example. In addition, the memory 10b-60 may include a decoded picture buffer (DPB), and may be configured by a digital storage medium. The hardware component of the memory 10b-60 may be configured as an internal or external component. When a bitstream including video/image information is input, the decoding apparatus 10b may reconstruct an image corresponding to a process in which the video/image information is processed in the encoding apparatus 10a of FIG. 2. For example, the decoding apparatus 10b may derive units/blocks based on block division related information obtained from the bitstream. The decoding apparatus 10b may perform decoding by using a processing unit applied in the encoding apparatus. Thus, the processing unit of decoding may be, for example, a coding unit, and the coding unit may be divided according to a quad tree structure, a binary tree structure, and/or a ternary tree structure from a coding tree unit or a largest coding unit. One or more transformers may be derived from a coding unit. In addition, the reconstructed image signal decoded and output through the decoding apparatus 10b may be reproduced through the playback device. The decoding apparatus 10b may receive a signal output from the encoding apparatus 10a of FIG. 2 in the form of a bitstream, and the received signal may be decoded through the entropy decoder 10b-10. For example, the entropy decoder 10b-10 may parse the bitstream to derive information (e.g., video/image information) required for image restoration (or picture restoration). The video/image information may further include information about various parameter sets, such as an adaptation parameter set (APS), a picture parameter set (PPS), a sequence parameter set (SPS), or a video parameter set (VPS). In addition, the video/image information may further include general constraint information. The decoding apparatus may decode the picture further based on the information on the parameter set and/or the general restriction information. Signaling/received information and/or syntax elements, described later in the present disclosure, may be decoded through the decoding procedure and obtained from the bitstream. For example, the entropy decoder 10b-10 may decode information in the bitstream on the basis of a coding method such as exponential Golomb, CAVLC, or CABAC and may output syntax element values necessary for image reconstruction and quantized values of transform coefficients with respect to residual. More specifically, the CABAC entropy decoding method receives a bin corresponding to each syntax element in the bitstream, determines a context model using decoding target syntax element information and decoding information of neighboring and decoding target blocks or information on symbols/bins decoded in a previous stage, predicts bin generation probability according to the determined context model and performs arithmetic decoding of bins to generate a symbol corresponding to each syntax element value. In this case, the CABAC entropy decoding method may update the context model by using the decoded symbol/bin information for the context model of the next symbol/bin after determining the context model. Information about prediction among the information decoded by the entropy decoder 10b-10 is provided to the predictor 10b-30, and information about the residual on which entropy decoding is provided by the entropy decoder 10b-10. That is, the quantized transform coefficients and related parameter information may be input to the dequantizer 10b-21. Also, information on filtering among the information decoded by the entropy decoder 10b-10 may be provided to the filter 10b-50. On the other hand, a receiver (not shown) that receives a signal output from the encoding apparatus may be further configured as an internal/external element of the decoding apparatus 10b, or the receiver may be a component of the entropy decoder 10b-10. On the other hand, the decoding apparatus according to the present disclosure may be referred to as a video/image/picture decoding apparatus, and the decoding apparatus may be divided into an information decoder (video/image/picture information decoder) and a sample decoder (video/image/picture sample decoder). The information decoder may include the entropy decoder 10b-10, and the sample decoder may include at least one of the dequantizer 10b-21, the inverse transformer 10b-22, the predictor 10b-30, the adder 10b-40, the filter 10b-50, and the memory 10b-60. The dequantizer 10b-21 may inverse quantize the quantized transform coefficients to output the transform coefficients. The dequantizer 10b-21 may rearrange the quantized transform coefficients in a two-dimensional block form. In this case, the rearrangement may be performed based on the coefficient scan order performed by the encoding device. The dequantizer 10b-21 may perform inverse quantization on the quantized transform coefficients using a quantization parameter (e.g., quantization step size information) and obtain transform coefficients. The dequantizer 10b-21 may perform inverse quantization on the quantized transform coefficients using a quantization parameter (e.g., quantization step size information) and obtain transform coefficients. The inverse transformer 10b-22 inverse transforms the transform coefficients to obtain a residual signal (residual block, residual sample array). The predictor may perform prediction on the current block and generate a predicted block including prediction samples for the current block. The predictor may determine whether intra prediction or inter prediction is applied to the current block based on the prediction information output from the entropy decoder 10b-10, and may determine a specific intra/inter prediction mode. The predictor may generate a prediction signal based on various prediction methods to be described later. For example, the predictor may apply intra prediction or inter prediction to predict one block, and may simultaneously apply intra prediction and inter prediction. This can be referred to as combined inter and intra prediction (CIIP). In addition, the predictor may perform intra block copy (IBC) to predict the block. IBC may be used for video/video coding of content such as a game, for example, screen content coding (SCC). IBC basically performs prediction within the current picture, but may be performed similarly to inter prediction in that a reference block is derived within the current picture. That is, IBC may use at least one of the inter prediction techniques described in the present disclosure. The intra predictor 10b-32 may predict the current block with reference to samples in the current picture. The referenced samples may be located in the vicinity of the current block or may be located apart from each other according to the prediction mode. In intra prediction, prediction modes may include a plurality of non-directional modes and a plurality of directional modes. The intra predictor 10b-32 may determine the prediction mode applied to the current block by using the prediction mode applied to the neighboring block. The inter predictor 10b-31 may derive the predicted block for the current block based on the reference block (reference sample array) specified by the motion vector on the reference picture. In this case, in order to reduce the amount of motion information transmitted in the inter prediction mode, the motion information may be predicted in units of blocks, subblocks, or samples based on the correlation between motion information between neighboring blocks and the current block. The motion information may include a motion vector and a reference picture index. The motion information may further include inter prediction direction (L0 prediction, L1 prediction, Bi prediction, and the like) information. In the case of inter prediction, the neighboring blocks may include spatial neighboring blocks existing in the current picture and temporal neighboring blocks present in the reference picture. For example, the inter predictor 10b-31 may construct a motion information candidate list based on neighboring blocks, and derive a motion vector and/or a reference picture index of the current block based on the received candidate selection information. Inter prediction may be performed based on various prediction modes, and the information on the prediction may include information indicating the mode of inter prediction for the current block. The adder 10b-40 may generate a reconstructed signal (reconstructed picture, reconstructed block, or reconstructed sample array) by adding the obtained residual signal to the predicted signal (predicted block or predicted sample array) output from the predictor 10b-30. When there is no residual with respect to the processing target block as in a case in which the skip mode is applied, the predicted block may be used as a reconstructed block. The adder 10b-40 may be referred to as a restoration unit or a restoration block generation unit. The generated reconstructed signal may be used for intra prediction of the next processing object block in the current picture, may be output through filtering as described below, or may be used for inter prediction of the next picture. Meanwhile, luma mapping with chroma scaling (LMCS) may be applied in the picture decoding process. The filter 10b-50 can improve subjective/objective picture quality by applying filtering to the reconstructed signal. For example, the filter 10b-50 can generate a modified reconstructed picture by applying various filtering methods to the reconstructed picture and transmit the modified reconstructed picture to a memory 60, specifically to the DPB. The various filtering methods may include, for example, deblocking filtering, sample adaptive offset, adaptive loop filter, and bilateral filter. The (modified) reconstructed picture stored in the DPB of the memory 10b-60 may be used as a reference picture in the inter predictor 10b-31. The memory 10b-60 may store motion information of a block in which motion information in the current picture is derived (or decoded) and/or motion information of blocks in an already reconstructed picture. The stored motion information may be transmitted to the inter predictor 10b-31 to be used as motion information of a spatial neighboring block or motion information of a temporal neighboring block. The memory 10b-60 may store reconstructed samples of blocks reconstructed in the current picture, and may transmit the reconstructed samples to the intra predictor 10b-32. In the present disclosure, examples described in the predictor 10b-30, the dequantizer 10b-21, the inverse transformer 10b-22, and the filter 10b-50 of the decoding apparatus 10b may be applied to be the same or corresponding to the predictor 10a-20, the dequantizer 10a-34, the inverse transformer 10a-35, and the filter 10a-60 of the encoding apparatus 10a, respectively. As described above, in video coding, prediction is performed to increase compression efficiency. Through this, it is possible to generate a predicted block including prediction samples for the current block, which is a block to be coded. Here, the predicted block includes prediction samples in a spatial domain (or pixel domain). The predicted block is derived identically in the encoding device and the decoding apparatus. The encoding apparatus may increase image coding efficiency by signaling, to the decoding apparatus, information (residual information) about the residual between the original block and the predicted block, rather than the original sample value of the original block itself. The decoding apparatus may derive a residual block including residual samples based on the residual information, may generate a reconstructed block including reconstructed samples by adding the residual block and the predicted block, and may generate a reconstructed picture including the reconstructed blocks. The residual information may be generated through transformation and quantization procedures. For example, the encoding apparatus derives a residual block between the original block and the predicted block, and performs a transform procedure on residual samples (residual sample array) included in the residual block to derive transform coefficients, and by performing a quantization procedure on the transform coefficients to derive quantized transform coefficients, the associated residual information may be signaled to the decoding apparatus (via a bitstream). Here, the residual information may include value information of the quantized transform coefficients, location information, a transform technique, a transform kernel, and information such as a quantization parameter. The decoding apparatus may perform an inverse quantization/inverse transformation procedure based on the residual information and derive residual samples (or residual blocks). The decoding apparatus may generate a reconstructed picture based on the predicted block and the residual block. The encoding apparatus may also inverse quantize/inverse transform the quantized transform coefficients for reference for inter prediction of a later picture to derive a residual block, and generate a reconstructed picture based thereon. Scalable Video Coding Scalable video coding (SVC) refers to a complex bitstream video that includes several types of images in one bitstream, and may provide video services in various networks and heterogeneous terminal environments by compressing several types of images into one complex bitstream. SVC may be transformed into scalable feature coding (SFC) for a machine task. The SFC may generate a complex bitstream feature map including several types of feature maps in one bitstream. As described above, by compressing various types of feature maps into one complex bit stream, a machine analysis service can be provided in various networks and heterogeneous terminal environments. SFC is a technology that allows a decoding apparatus to selectively decode a part of a bitstream. The encoded bitstream may include a base layer and at least one enhancement layer. The base layer and at least one enhancement layer may be arranged in a specific order within the encoded bitstream. However, the present disclosure is not limited to the enhancement layer, and the enhancement layer may be referred to as various layers such as an extension layer, an additional layer, and a lower layer. SVC or SFC includes various scalable encoding modes. For example, a mode for spatial scalability provides layers of spatial resolution, and a mode for temporal scalability provides layers of frame rate. In addition, quality scalability, complexity scalability, and the like provide a layer for the visual quality of an image or a feature quality of a feature map and a layer for the complexity of the decoding method. In the mode for spatial scalability, the base layer of an image or feature map contains encoded frames of reduced resolution. When only the base layer is decoded, a low-resolution output image and/or feature map can be obtained. When one or more enhancement layers are decoded together with the base layer, a high-resolution output image and/or feature map can be obtained. In the mode for temporal scalability, the base layer is encoded with a low video or feature map frame rate. Although the frame rate is low when only the base layer is decoded, the frame rate can be increased by decoding the base layer and at least one enhancement layer together. The enhancement layer may include I-VOP encoded without prediction, P-VOP predicted from VOP of a previous layer and subsequent base layer VOP, and B-VOP predicted from VOP of previous and subsequent layers. An input signal used for SVC or SFC may have a different resolution, frame rate, bit-depth, color format, aspect ratio, and the like between layers as described above. Accordingly, by performing prediction between layers in consideration of this point, it is possible to reduce redundancy and increase encoding performance compared to simulcast. Various inter-layer prediction methods may be used. In order to reduce the amount of information about the encoder, the predictor, and the transformer transmitted in the enhancement layer, prediction of the encoder/predictor/transformer between layers may be performed. FIG. 4 illustrates an encoding and decoding process using SVC. Referring to FIG. 4, the encoding apparatus 10a may perform SVC encoding or SFC encoding on an original video (e.g., UHD video), so that the video or feature map stream of several layers may be divided and transmitted. The various layers may include, for example, a base layer, a first enhancement layer, and a second enhancement layer as illustrated. The base layer may be for an image of a basic resolution (e.g., SD resolution) as described later, and the first enhancement layer may include information not included in the base layer for an image of a first resolution (e.g., FHD resolution). The second enhancement layer may include information not included in the base layer and the first enhancement layer for an image of a second resolution (e.g., UHD resolution). The base layer may be for a feature map of a base resolution (e.g., a minimum feature map resolution such as 224Ã\u0097224Ã\u00973) as described later, the first enhancement layer may include information not included in the base layer for the feature map of the first resolution (e.g., 512Ã\u0097512Ã\u00973 resolution). The second enhancement layer may include information not included in the first base layer and the second enhancement layer for a second resolution (e.g., a 720Ã\u0097720Ã\u00973 feature map). A video stream including the base layer, the first enhancement layer, and the second enhancement layer may be transmitted. The extractor extracts the base layer and one or more enhancement layers from the received bitstream, and transmits them to the decoding apparatus 10b. When the decoding apparatus 10b decodes only the base layer, a low-resolution output image may be obtained. However, if the decoding device 10b decodes one or more enhancement layers together with the base layer, a high-resolution output image may be obtained. Neural Processing Unit FIG. 5 illustrates a neural processing unit according to the present disclosure. Referring to FIG. 5, a neural processing unit (NPU) 100 is a processor specialized to perform an operation for an artificial neural network. The artificial neural network refers to a network in which are collected artificial neurons which, when various inputs or entry stimulations, multiply a weight by the inputs or stimulations, add the multiplied values, and convert a value obtained by additionally adding a deviation using an active function to transmit. The artificial neural network trained as described above may be used to output an inference result from input data. The NPU 100 may be a semiconductor device implemented by an electric/electronic circuit. The electric/electronic circuit may refer to a circuit including a large number of electronic elements (transistors, capacitors, etc.). The NPU 100 may include a plurality of processing elements (PE) 110, an NPU internal memory 120, an NPU scheduler 130, and an NPU interface 140. Each of the plurality of processing elements 110, the NPU internal memory 120, the NPU scheduler 130, and the NPU interface 140 may be a semiconductor circuit to which a large number of the electronic elements are connected. Therefore, some of electronic elements may be difficult to identify or be distinguished with the naked eye, but may be identified only by an operation. For example, an arbitrary circuit may operate as a plurality of the processing elements 110, or may operate as an NPU scheduler 130. The NPU scheduler 130 may be configured to perform the function of the control unit configured to control the artificial neural network inference operation of the NPU 100. The NPU 100 may include the plurality of processing elements 110, the NPU internal memory 120 configured to store an artificial neural network model inferred from the plurality of processing elements 110, and the NPU scheduler 130 configured to control the operation schedule with respect to the plurality of processing elements 110 and the NPU internal memory 120. The NPU 100 may be configured to process the feature map corresponding to the encoding and decoding method using SVC or SFC. The plurality of processing elements 110 may perform an operation for an artificial neural network. The NPU interface 140 may communicate with various components connected to the NPU 100, for example, memories, via a system bus. The NPU scheduler 130 may be configured to control an operation of the plurality of processing elements 110 and read/write instructions of the NPU internal memory 120 for an inference operation of the neural processing unit 100. The NPU scheduler 130 may control the plurality of processing elements 110 and the NPU internal memory 120 based on the data locality information or the information about the structure of the artificial neural network model. The NPU scheduler 130 may analyze or receive analyzed information on a structure of an artificial neural network model which may operate in the plurality of processing elements 110. For example, data of the artificial neural network, which may be included in the artificial neural network model may include node data (i.e., feature map) of each layer, data on a layout of layers, locality information of layers or information about the structure, and at least a portion of weight data (i.e., weight kernel) of each of connection networks connecting the nodes of the layers. The data of the artificial neural network may be stored in a memory provided in the NPU scheduler 130 or the NPU internal memory 120. The NPU scheduler 130 may schedule an operation order of the artificial neural network model to be processed by an NPU 100 based on the data locality information or the information about the structure of the artificial neural network model. The NPU scheduler 130 may acquire a memory address value in which feature map of a layer of the artificial neural network model and weight data are stored based on the data locality information or the information about the structure of the artificial neural network model. For example, the NPU scheduler 130 may acquire the memory address value of the feature map of the layer of the artificial neural network model and the weight data which are stored in the memory. Accordingly, the NPU scheduler 130 may acquire feature map of a layer and weight data of an artificial neural network model to be driven from the main memory, to store the acquired data in the NPU internal memory 120. Feature map of each layer may have a corresponding memory address value. Each of the weight data may have a corresponding memory address value. The NPU scheduler 130 may schedule an operation order of the plurality of processing elements 110 based on the data locality information or the information about the structure of the artificial neural network model, for example, the layout information of layers of the artificial neural network or the information about the structure of the artificial neural network model. The NPU scheduler 130 schedules based on the data locality information or the information about the structure of the artificial neural network model so that the NPU scheduler may operate in a different way from a scheduling concept of a normal CPU. The scheduling of the normal CPU operates to provide the highest efficiency in consideration of fairness, efficiency, stability, and reaction time. That is, the normal CPU schedules to perform the most processing during the same time in consideration of a priority and an operation time. A conventional CPU uses an algorithm which schedules a task in consideration of data such as a priority or an operation processing time of each processing. In contrast, the NPU scheduler 130 may control the NPU 100 according to a determined processing order of the NPU 100 based on the data locality information or the information about the structure of the artificial neural network model. Moreover, the NPU scheduler 130 may operate the NPU 100 according to the determined the processing order based on the data locality information or the information about the structure of the artificial neural network model and/or data locality information or information about a structure of the NPU 100 to be used. However, the present disclosure is not limited to the data locality information or the information about the structure of the NPU 100. The NPU scheduler 130 may be configured to store the data locality information or the information about the structure of the artificial neural network. That is, even though only the data locality information or the information about the structure of the artificial neural network of the artificial neural network model is utilized, the NPU scheduler 130 may determine a processing sequence. Moreover, the NPU scheduler 130 may determine the processing order of the NPU 100 by considering the data locality information or the information about the structure of the artificial neural network model and data locality information or information about a structure of the NPU 100. Furthermore, optimization of the processing is possible according to the determined processing order. The plurality of processing elements 110 refers to a configuration in which a plurality of processing elements PE1 to PE12 configured to operate feature map and weight data of the artificial neural network is disposed. Each processing element may include a multiply and accumulate (MAC) operator and/or an arithmetic logic unit (ALU) operator, but the examples according to the present disclosure are not limited thereto. Each processing element may be configured to optionally further include an additional special function unit for processing the additional special function. For example, it is also possible for the processing element PE to be modified and implemented to further include a batch-normalization unit, an activation function unit, an interpolation unit, and the like. Even though FIG. 5 illustrates a plurality of processing elements as an example, operators implemented by a plurality of multiplier and adder trees may also be configured to be disposed in parallel in one processing element, instead of the MAC. In this case, the plurality of processing elements 110 may also be referred to as at least one processing element including a plurality of operators. The plurality of processing elements 110 is configured to include a plurality of processing elements PE1 to PE12. The plurality of processing elements PE1 to PE12 of FIG. 5 is just an example for the convenience of description and the number of the plurality of processing elements PE1 to PE12 is not limited. A size or the number of processing element arrays 110 may be determined by the number of the plurality of processing elements PE1 to PE12. The size of the plurality of processing elements 110 may be implemented by an NÃ\u0097M matrix. Here, N and M are integers greater than zero. The plurality of processing elements 110 may include NÃ\u0097M processing elements. That is, one or more processing elements may be provided. A size of the plurality of processing elements 110 may be designed in consideration of the characteristic of the artificial neural network model in which the NPU 100 operates. The plurality of processing elements 110 is configured to perform a function such as addition, multiplication, and accumulation required for the artificial neural network operation. In other words, the plurality of processing elements 110 may be configured to perform a multiplication and accumulation (MAC) operation. Hereinafter, a first processing element PE1 among the plurality of processing elements 110 will be explained with an example. FIG. 6 illustrates one processing element among a plurality of processing elements that may be applied to the present disclosure. The NPU 100 according to the examples of the present disclosure may include the plurality of processing elements 110, the NPU internal memory 120 configured to store an artificial neural network model inferred from the plurality of processing elements 110, and the NPU scheduler 130 configured to control the plurality of processing elements 110 and the NPU internal memory 120 based on data locality information or information about a structure of the artificial neural network model. The plurality of processing elements 110 is configured to perform the MAC operation and the plurality of processing elements 110 is configured to quantize and output the MAC operation result, but the examples of the present disclosure are not limited thereto. The NPU internal memory 120 may store all or a part of the artificial neural network model in accordance with the memory size and the data size of the artificial neural network model. The first processing element PE1 may include a multiplier 111, an adder 112, an accumulator 113, and a bit quantizer 114. However, the examples according to the present disclosure are not limited thereto and the plurality of processing elements 110 may be modified in consideration of the operation characteristic of the artificial neural network. The multiplier 111 multiplies input (N) bit data and (M) bit data. The operation value of the multiplier 111 is output as (N+M) bit data. The multiplier 111 may be configured to receive one variable and one constant. The accumulator 113 accumulates an operation value of the multiplier 111 and an operation value of the accumulator 113 using the adder 112 as many times as the number of (L) loops. Therefore, a bit width of data of an output unit and an input unit of the accumulator 113 may be output to (N+M+log 2(L)) bits. Here, L is an integer greater than zero. When the accumulation is completed, the accumulator 113 is applied with an initialization reset to initialize the data stored in the accumulator 113 to zero, but the examples according to the present disclosure are not limited thereto. The bit quantizer 114 may reduce the bit width of the data output from the accumulator 113. The bit quantizer 114 may be controlled by the NPU scheduler 130. The bit width of the quantized data may be output to (X) bits. Here, X is an integer greater than zero. According to the above-described configuration, the plurality of processing elements 110 is configured to perform the MAC operation and the plurality of processing elements 110 may quantize the MAC operation result to output the result. The quantization may have an effect that the larger the (L) loops, the smaller the power consumption. Further, when the power consumption is reduced, the heat generation may also be reduced. Specifically, when the heat generation is reduced, the possibility of the erroneous operation of the NPU 100 due to the high temperature may be reduced. Output data (X) bits of the bit quantizer 114 may serve as node data of a subsequent layer or input data of a convolution. When the artificial neural network model is quantized, the bit quantizer 114 may be configured to be supplied with quantized information from the artificial neural network model. However, it is not limited thereto and the NPU scheduler 130 may also be configured to extract quantized information by analyzing the artificial neural network model. Accordingly, the output data (X) bit is converted to a quantized bit width to be output so as to correspond to the quantized data size. The output data (X) bit of the bit quantizer 114 may be stored in the NPU internal memory 120 with a quantized bit width. The plurality of processing elements 110 of the NPU 100 according to an example of the present disclosure may include a multiplier 111, an adder 112, and an accumulator 113. The bit quantizer 114 may be selected according to whether quantization is applied or not. FIG. 7 illustrates a modified example of the neural processing unit 100 of FIG. 5. The NPU 100 of FIG. 7 is substantially the same as the processor 100 exemplarily illustrated in FIG. 5, except for the plurality of processing elements 110. Thus, redundant description will be omitted for the convenience of description. The plurality of processing elements 110 exemplarily illustrated in FIG. 7 may further include register files RF1 to RF12 corresponding to processing elements PE1 to PE12 in addition to a plurality of processing elements PE1 to PE12. The plurality of processing elements PE1 to PE12 and the plurality of register files RF1 to RF12 of FIG. 7 are just an example for the convenience of description and the number of the plurality of processing elements PE1 to PE12 and the plurality of register files RF1 to RF12 is not limited. A size of, or the number of, processing element arrays 110 may be determined by the number of the plurality of processing elements PE1 to PE12 and the plurality of register files RF1 to RF12. The size of the plurality of processing elements 110 and the plurality of register files RF1 to RF12 may be implemented by an NÃ\u0097M matrix. Here, N and M are integers greater than zero. An array size of the plurality of processing elements 110 may be designed in consideration of the characteristic of the artificial neural network model in which the NPU 100 operates. For additional explanation, the memory size of the register file may be determined in consideration of a data size, a required operating speed, and a required power consumption of the artificial neural network model to operate. The register files RF1 to RF12 of the NPU 100 are static memory units which are directly connected to the processing elements PE1 to PE12. For example, the register files RF1 to RF12 may be configured by flip-flops and/or latches. The register files RF1 to RF12 may be configured to store the MAC operation value of the corresponding processing elements PE1 to PE12. The register files RF1 to RF12 may be configured to provide or be provided with the weight data and/or node data to or from the NPU internal memory 120. It is also possible that the register files RF1 to RF12 are configured to perform a function of a temporary memory of the accumulator during MAC operation. FIG. 8 illustrates an exemplary artificial neural network model. Hereinafter, an operation of an exemplary artificial neural network model 110-10 which may operate in the NPU 100 will be explained. The exemplary artificial neural network model 110-10 of FIG. 4 may be an artificial neural network which is trained in the NPU 100 as shown in FIG. 1 or FIG. 4 or trained in a separate machine learning device. The artificial neural network model may be an artificial neural network which is trained to perform various inference functions such as object recognition or voice recognition. The artificial neural network model 110-10 may be a deep neural network (DNN). However, the artificial neural network model 110-10 according to the examples of the present disclosure is not limited to the deep neural network. For example, the artificial neural network model may be a trained model to perform inference such as object detection, object segmentation, image/video reconstruction, image/video enhancement, object tracking, event recognition, event prediction, anomaly detection, density estimation, event search, measurement, and the like. For example, the artificial neural network model can be a model such as Bisenet, Shelfnet, Alexnet, Densenet, Efficientnet, EfficientDet, Googlenet, Mnasnet, Mobilenet, Resnet, Shufflenet, Squeezenet, VGG, Yolo, RNN, CNN, DBN, RBM, LSTM, and the like. For example, the artificial neural network model may be a model such as a generative adversarial network (GAN), a transformer, or the like. However, the present disclosure is not limited thereto, and new artificial neural network models to operate in the NPU are being continuously released. However, the present disclosure is not limited thereto. Further, the artificial neural network model 110-10 may be an ensemble model based on at least two different models. The artificial neural network model 110-10 may be stored in the NPU internal memory 120 of the NPU 100. Hereinafter, an inference process by the exemplary artificial neural network model 110-10, being performed by the NPU 100, will be described with reference to FIG. 5. The artificial neural network model 110-10 may be an exemplary deep neural network model including an input layer 110-11, a first connection network 110-12, a first hidden layer 110-13, a second connection network 110-14, a second hidden layer 110-15, a third connection network 110-16, and an output layer 110-17. However, the present disclosure is not limited only to the artificial neural network model illustrated in FIG. 8. The first hidden layer 110-13 and the second hidden layer 110-15 may also be referred to as a plurality of hidden layers. The input layer 110-11 may exemplarily include input nodes x1 and x2. That is, the input layer 110-11 may include information about two input values. The NPU scheduler 130 illustrated in FIG. 5 or 7 may set a memory address in which information about an input value from the input layer 110-11 is stored, in the NPU internal memory 120 of FIG. 5 or 7. For example, the first connection network 110-12 may include information about six weight values for connecting nodes of the input layer 110-11 to nodes of the first hidden layer 110-13, respectively. The NPU scheduler 130 of FIG. 5 or 7 may set a memory address, in which information about a weight value of the first connection network 110-12 is stored, in the NPU internal memory 120. Each weight value is multiplied with the input node value, and an accumulated value of the multiplied values is stored in the first hidden layer 110-13. Here, the nodes may be referred to as a feature map. For example, the first hidden layer 110-13 may include nodes a1, a2, and a3. That is, the first hidden layer 110-13 may include information about three node values. The NPU scheduler 130 illustrated in FIG. 5 or 7 may set a memory address for storing information about a node value of the first hidden layer 110-13, in the NPU internal memory 120. The NPU scheduler 130 may be configured to schedule an operation order so that the first processing element PE1 performs the MAC operation of the a1 node of the first hidden layer 110-13. The NPU scheduler 130 may be configured to schedule the operation order so that the second processing element PE2 performs the MAC operation of the a2 node of the first hidden layer 110-13. The NPU scheduler 130 may be configured to schedule an operation order so that the third processing element PE3 performs the MAC operation of the a3 node of the first hidden layer 110-13. Here, the NPU scheduler 130 may pre-schedule the operation order so that the three processing elements perform each MAC operation simultaneously in parallel. For example, the second connection network 110-14 may include information about nine weight values for connecting nodes of the first hidden layer 110-13 to nodes of the second hidden layer 110-15, respectively. The NPU scheduler 130 of FIG. 5 or 7 may set a memory address for storing, in the NPU internal memory 120, information about a weight value of the second connection network 110-14. The weight value of the second connection network 110-14 is multiplied with the node value input from the corresponding first hidden layer 110-13 and the accumulated value of the multiplied values is stored in the second hidden layer 110-15. For example, the second hidden layer 110-15 may include nodes b1, b2, and b3. That is, the second hidden layer 110-15 may include information about three node values. The NPU scheduler 130 may set a memory address for storing information about a node value of the second hidden layer 110-15, in the NPU internal memory 120. The NPU scheduler 130 may be configured to schedule an operation order so that the fourth processing element PE4 performs the MAC operation of the b1 node of the second hidden layer 110-15. The NPU scheduler 130 may be configured to schedule an operation order so that the fifth processing element PE5 performs the MAC operation of the b2 node of the second hidden layer 110-15. The NPU scheduler 130 may be configured to schedule an operation order so that the sixth processing element PE6 performs the MAC operation of the b3 node of the second hidden layer 110-15. Here, the NPU scheduler 130 may pre-schedule the operation order so that the three processing elements perform each MAC operation simultaneously in parallel. Here, the NPU scheduler 130 may determine scheduling so that the operation of the second hidden layer 110-15 is performed after the MAC operation of the first hidden layer 110-13 of the artificial neural network model. That is, the NPU scheduler 130 may be configured to control the plurality of processing elements 100 and the NPU internal memory 120 based on the data locality information or structure information of the artificial neural network model. For example, the third connection network 110-16 may include information about six weight values which connect nodes of the second hidden layer 110-15 and nodes of the output layer 110-17, respectively. The NPU scheduler 130 may set a memory address for storing, in the NPU internal memory 120, information about a weight value of the third connection network 110-16. The weight value of the third connection network 110-16 is multiplied with the node value input from the second hidden layer 110-15, and the accumulated value of the multiplied values is stored in the output layer 110-17. For example, the output layer 110-17 may include nodes y1 and y2. That is, the output layer 110-17 may include information about two node values. The NPU scheduler 130 may set a memory address for storing, in the NPU internal memory 120, information about a node value of the output layer 110-17. The NPU scheduler 130 may be configured to schedule the operation order so that the seventh processing element PE7 performs the MAC operation of the y1 node of the output layer 110-17. The NPU scheduler 130 may be configured to schedule the operation order so that the eighth processing element PE8 performs the MAC operation of the y2 node of the output layer 110-15. Here, the NPU scheduler 130 may pre-schedule the operation order so that the two processing elements simultaneously perform the MAC operation in parallel. Here, the NPU scheduler 130 may determine the scheduling so that the operation of the output layer 110-17 is performed after the MAC operation of the second hidden layer 110-15 of the artificial neural network model. That is, the NPU scheduler 130 may be configured to control the plurality of processing elements 100 and the NPU internal memory 120 based on the data locality information or structure information of the artificial neural network model. That is, the NPU scheduler 130 may analyze a structure of an artificial neural network model or receive the analyzed information which may operate in the plurality of processing elements 110. Information of the artificial neural network, which may be included in the artificial neural network model, may include information about a node value of each layer, placement data locality information of layers or information about the structure, and information about a weight value of each of connection networks connecting the nodes of the layers. The NPU scheduler 130 is provided with data locality information or information about a structure of the exemplary artificial neural network model 110-10 so that the NPU scheduler 130 may determine an operation order from input to output of the artificial neural network model 110-10. Accordingly, the NPU scheduler 130 may set the memory address in which the MAC operation values of each layer are stored, in the NPU internal memory 120, in consideration of the scheduling order. That is, the NPU system memory 120 may be configured to preserve weight data of connection networks stored in the NPU system memory 120 while the inference operation of the NPU 100 is maintained. Therefore, frequency of the memory reading and writing operations may be reduced. That is, the NPU system memory 120 may be configured to reuse the MAC operation value stored in the NPU system memory 120 while the inference operation is maintained. FIG. 9A diagrams the basic structure of a convolutional neural network. Referring to FIG. 9A, a convolutional neural network may be a combination of one or a plurality of convolutional layers, a pooling layer, and a fully connected layer. In the example of the present disclosure, in the convolutional neural network, there is a kernel for extracting features of an input image of a channel for each channel. The kernel may be composed of a two-dimensional matrix, and convolution operation is performed while traversing input data. The size of the kernel may be arbitrarily determined, and the stride at which the kernel traverses input data may also be arbitrarily determined. A result of convolution of all input data per kernel may be referred to as a feature map or an activation map. Hereinafter, the kernel may include a set of weight values or a plurality of sets of weight values. The number of kernels for each layer may be referred to as the number of channels. The kernel may be referred to as a matrix-type weight, or the kernel may be referred to as a weight. As such, since the convolution operation is an operation formed by combining input data and a kernel, an activation function for adding non-linearity may be applied thereafter. When an activation function is applied to a feature map that is a result of a convolution operation, it may be referred to as an activation map. Specifically, referring to FIG. 9A, the convolutional neural network includes at least one convolutional layer, at least one pooling layer, and at least one fully connected layer. For example, convolution can be defined by two main parameters: the size of the input data (typically a 1Ã\u00971, 3Ã\u00973, or 5Ã\u00975 matrix) and the depth of the output feature map (the number of kernels). These key parameters can be computed by convolution. These convolutions may start at depth 32, continue to depth 64, and end at depth 128 or 256. The convolution operation may mean an operation of sliding a kernel of size 3Ã\u00973 or 5Ã\u00975 over an input image matrix that is input data, multiplying each weight of the kernel and each element of the input image matrix that overlaps, and then adding them all. An activation function may be applied to the output feature map generated in this way to finally output an activation map. In addition, the weight used in the current layer may be transmitted to the next layer through convolution. The pooling layer may perform a pooling operation to reduce the size of the feature map by down-sampling the output data (i.e., the activation map). For example, the pooling operation may include, but is not limited to, max pooling and/or average pooling. The maximum pooling operation uses the kernel, and outputs the maximum value in the area of the feature map overlapping the kernel by sliding the feature map and the kernel. The average pooling operation outputs an average value within the area of the feature map overlapping the kernel by sliding the feature map and the kernel. As such, since the size of the feature map is reduced by the pooling operation, the number of weights of the feature map is also reduced. The fully connected layer may classify data output through the pooling layer into a plurality of classes (i.e., inferenced values), and output the classified class and a score thereof. Data output through the pooling layer forms a three-dimensional feature map, and this three-dimensional feature map can be converted into a one-dimensional vector and input as a fully connected layer. FIG. 9B illustrates the operation of a convolutional neural network in an easy-to-understand manner. Referring to FIG. 5B, the input image is a two-dimensional matrix that is 5Ã\u00975 in size. Further, in FIG. 5B, three nodes, that is, a channel 1, a channel 2, and a channel 3, are used. First, a convolution operation of the layer 1 will be described. The input image is convoluted with a kernel 1 for a channel 1 at a first node of the layer 1, and a feature map 1 is output as a result. Further, the input image is convoluted with a kernel 2 for a channel 2 at a second node of the layer 1, and a feature map 2 is output as a result. The input image is convoluted with a kernel 3 for a channel 3 at a third node, and a feature map 3 is output as a result. Next, a pooling operation of the layer 2 will be described. The feature map 1, the feature map 2, and the feature map 3 output from the layer 1 are input to three nodes of the layer 2. Layer 2 receives feature maps output from the layer 1 as inputs to perform the pooling. The pooling may reduce a size or emphasize a specific value in the matrix. The pooling method may include max pooling, average pooling, and minimum pooling. The max pooling is used to collect maximum values in a specific area of the matrix, and the average pooling is used to calculate an average in a specific area. In order to process each convolution, the processing elements PE1 to PE12 of the NPU 100 are configured to perform a MAC operation. In the example of FIG. 9B, a feature map of a 5Ã\u00975 matrix is reduced to a 4Ã\u00974 matrix by the pooling. Specifically, the first node of the layer 2 performs the pooling with the feature map 1 for the channel 1 as an input, and then outputs a 4Ã\u00974 matrix. The second node of the layer 2 performs the pooling with the feature map 2 for the channel 2 as an input, and then outputs a 4Ã\u00974 matrix. The third node of the layer 2 performs the pooling with the feature map 3 for the channel 3 as an input, and then outputs a 4Ã\u00974 matrix. Next, a convolution operation of the layer 3 will be described. A first node of the layer 3 receives the output from the first node of the layer 2 as an input to perform the convolution with a kernel 4 and output a result thereof. A second node of the layer 3 receives the output from the second node of the layer 2 as an input to perform the convolution with a kernel 5 for the channel 2 and outputs a result thereof. Similarly, a third node of the layer 3 receives the output from the third node of the layer 2 as an input to perform the convolution with a kernel 6 for the channel 3 and outputs a result thereof. As described above, the convolution and the pooling are repeated and finally, as illustrated in FIG. 9A, a fully connected layer may be output. The output may be input to the artificial neural network for image recognition again. Video Coding for Machines Recently, with the development of various industrial fields such as surveillance, intelligent transportation, smart city, intelligent industry, and intelligent Content, the amount of image or feature map data consumed by machines is increasing. On the other hand, the traditional image compression method currently in use is a technology developed in consideration of the characteristics of human vision perceived by the viewer and contains unnecessary information, making it inefficient in performing machine tasks. Therefore, there is a demand for a study on a video codec technology for efficiently compressing a feature map for performing a machine task. Video coding for machine (VCM) technology is being discussed in the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG), an international standardization group for multimedia encoding. VCM is an image or feature map encoding technology that is based on the machine vision, not the viewer's point of view. Present Disclosure FIGS. 10A to 10D respectively illustrate configurations of an NPU including a VCM encoder and an NPU including a VCM decoder. Referring to FIG. 10A, the first NPU 100a may include a VCM encoder, and the second NPU 100b may include a VCM decoder. When the VCM encoder in the first NPU 100a encodes the video and/or the feature map and transmits it as a bitstream, the VCM decoder in the second NPU 100b may decode and output the bitstream. In this case, the VCM decoder in the second NPU 100b may output one or more videos and/or feature maps. For example, the VCM decoder in the second NPU 100b may output a first feature map for analysis using a machine, and may output a first image for viewing by a user. The first image may have a higher resolution than that of the first feature map. Referring to FIG. 10B, the first NPU 100a may include a feature extractor for extracting a feature map and a VCM encoder. The VCM encoder in the first NPU 100a may include a feature encoder. The second NPU 100b may include a VCM decoder. The VCM decoder in the second NPU 100b may include a feature decoder and a video reconstructor. The feature decoder may decode the feature map from the bitstream and output a first feature map for analysis using a machine. The video regenerator may regenerate and output a first image for viewing by a user from a bitstream. Referring to FIG. 10C, the first NPU 100a may include a feature extractor for extracting a feature map and a VCM encoder. The VCM encoder in the first NPU 100a may include a feature encoder. The second NPU 100b may include a VCM decoder. The VCM decoder in the second NPU 100b may include a feature decoder. The feature decoder may decode the feature map from the bitstream and output a first feature map for analysis using a machine. That is, the bitstream can be encoded only as a feature map, not as an image. In more detail, the feature map may be data including information on features for processing a specific task of a machine based on an image. Referring to FIG. 10D, the first NPU 100a may include a feature extractor for extracting a feature map and a VCM encoder. The VCM encoder in the first NPU 100a may include a feature converter and a video encoder. The second NPU 100b may include a VCM decoder. The VCM decoder in the second NPU 100b may include a video decoder and an inverse converter. Referring to FIGS. 10A to 10D, the first NPU 100a may include at least a VCM encoder, and the second NPU 100b may include at least a VCM decoder. However, the present disclosure is not limited thereto, and the VCM encoder may be modified to include the first NPU 100a, or the VCM decoder may be modified to include the second NPU 100b. The first NPU 100a may generate a feature map by processing an artificial intelligence operation (e.g., convolution). The first NPU 100a may be transmitted after encoding the feature map by processing the artificial intelligence operation. The second NPU 100b may receive the encoded feature map. The second NPU 100b may decode the encoded feature map by processing an artificial intelligence operation (e.g., deconvolution). In order to process artificial intelligence computation, an artificial neural network model of a specific structure can be used. For example, for feature map extraction, the NPU may process a convolution operation. For example, for feature map encoding, the NPU may process a convolution operation. For example, for decoding the encoded feature map, the NPU may process a deconvolution operation. The artificial neural network model may have a multi-layered structure, and the artificial neural network model may include a backbone network. The feature map generated through the artificial intelligence operation of the first NPU 100a may be a feature map generated in a specific layer of the multi-layered artificial neural network model. That is, the feature map may be at least one feature map generated in at least one layer of the multi-layered artificial neural network model. The feature map generated in a specific layer of the multi-layered artificial neural network model may be a feature map suitable for analysis using a specific machine. FIGS. 11A and 11B respectively illustrate positions of a bitstream in an artificial neural network model. As can be seen with reference to FIG. 11A, when the first NPU 100a or the VCM encoder receives a video, using an artificial neural network model (e.g., a convolutional network model), it is possible to generate feature maps. FIG. 11A shows an example of transmitting a feature map in a fully connected layer corresponding to the last layer of the convolutional network model as a bitstream. Then, the second NPU 100b or the VCM decoder may decode the bitstream including the feature map using the deconvolution network model. On the other hand, referring to FIG. 11B, an example is shown in which feature maps generated in intermediate layers of an artificial neural network model (e.g., a convolutional network model) are transmitted as a bitstream, rather than transmission of a feature map in a fully connected layer as a bitstream. FIG. 12 illustrates an example of the present disclosure. Referring to FIG. 12, the first NPU 100a and the second NPU 100b is shown. The server shown in FIG. 12 may transmit information about an artificial neural network (ANN) model, for example, information including weights of YoloV5s model to the first NPU 100a. The first NPU 100a may include a VCM encoder for encoding the input video. Although not shown, the first NPU 100a may further include a feature extractor as shown in FIG. 10B, 10C, or 10D. The VCM encoder in the first NPU 100a may include a feature encoder as shown in FIG. 10B or 10C. Alternatively, the VCM encoder in the first NPU 100a may include a feature converter and/or a video encoder as shown in FIG. 10D. The second NPU 100b may include at least one VCM decoder. The VCM decoder in the second NPU 100b may include a feature decoder and/or a video regenerator as shown in FIG. 10B. Alternatively, the VCM decoder in the second NPU 100b may include a feature decoder as shown in FIG. 10C. Alternatively, the VCM decoder in the second NPU 100b may include a video decoder and/or an inverse converter as shown in FIG. 10D. The VCM encoder in the first NPU 100a may support various scalable encoding modes. For example, a mode for spatial scalability provides layers of spatial resolution, and a mode for temporal scalability provides layers of frame rate. In addition, quality scalability and complexity scalability provide a layer of visual quality of an image and a layer of complexity of a decoding method. The base layer of the image and/or feature map with spatial scalability includes encoded frames of reduced resolution. When only the base layer is decoded, a low-resolution output image can be obtained. Decoding at least one enhancement layer along with the base layer can provide a high-resolution output image and/or feature map. The VCM encoder in the first NPU 100a performs SVC or SFC encoding on the original video and/or feature map (e.g., UHD or FHD video), so that it can be divided into video or feature map streams of several layers and transmitted. As illustrated, a plurality of layers may include, for example, a base layer, a first enhancement layer, and a second enhancement layer. The base layer may be encoded using a first artificial neural network model (e.g., YoloV5s 320), and the first enhancement layer may be encoded using a second artificial neural network model (e.g., YoloV5s 512). The second enhancement layer may be encoded using a second artificial neural network model. Alternatively, the second enhancement layer may be encoded using a video encoder in the VCM encoder shown in FIG. 10D. However, the present disclosure is not limited to the enhancement layer, and the enhancement layer may be referred to as various layers such as an extension layer, an additional layer, and a lower layer. The artificial neural network model may be, for example, YOLO. The you-only-look-once (YOLO) is an algorithm for object detection, and is an algorithm that can predict an object existing in an image and the position of the object by viewing the image only once. Instead of detecting it as an object to be classified, it approaches a single regression problem by dividing the bounding box multidimensionally and applying class probability. The input image is divided into a grid form of a tensor through CNN, and an object in the corresponding area is recognized by generating an object bounding box and class probability according to each section. Because YOLO does not apply a separate network for extracting candidate regions, it shows superior performance in terms of processing time than Faster R-CNN. A video stream including the base layer, the first enhancement layer, and the second enhancement layer may be transmitted. The VCM encoder may generate a bitstream including a specific number of enhancement layers according to an available bandwidth of a transmission channel. The VCM encoder may generate a bitstream in which at least one enhancement layer is selectively omitted according to an available bandwidth of a transmission channel. The VCM encoder may generate a bitstream to which at least one enhancement layer is selectively added according to an available bandwidth of a transmission channel. The VCM decoder may operate to receive only the base layer and at least some enhancement layers of the bitstream. The available bandwidth of the transmission channel may vary in real time or at a specific period. The available bandwidth of the transmission channel may be varied due to various reasons. For example, the bandwidth of a transmission channel may be reduced for a specific time according to an increase in the communication amount. Accordingly, the VCM encoder may be configured to acquire the available bandwidth of the transmission channel. The VCM encoder may vary the number of enhancement layers according to available bandwidth. The VCM encoder may be configured to encode the enhancement layer information included in the bitstream. Accordingly, the VCM decoder may be configured to determine the number of enhancement layers of the bitstream. In addition, the VCM decoder may be configured to detect an available bandwidth of the transport channel. The number of at least one enhancement layer included in one received frame may vary according to the state of the transmission channel. The NPU may determine the number of at least one enhancement layer included in the one received frame according to the state of a transmission channel, and feed it back to the encoding device. The at least one enhancement layer may be included in the one frame in an ascending order according to indexes of at least one enhancement layer. The extractor may extract the base layer and at least one enhancement layer from the received bitstream and transmit to the second NPU 100b. The second NPU 100b may decode by an adequate VCM decoder according to a required task. For example, as illustrated, for machine task No. 1, only the base layer in the video stream can be decoded. For decoding of the base layer, a first artificial neural network model (e.g., YoloV5s 320) may be used. Alternatively, for machine task No. 2, only the base layer and the first enhancement layer in the video stream can be decoded. For decoding of the base layer and the first enhancement layer, a second artificial neural network model (e.g., YoloV5s 512) may be used. Alternatively, for viewing by a user, the base layer and the first enhancement layer and the second enhancement layer in the video stream may be decoded.

                    "Description": "TECHNICAL FIELD The invention relates to a high frequency (HF) radio including an adjustable-bandwidth tunable bandpass filter for improved detection of incoming calls and methods for processing incoming calls. BACKGROUND High frequency (HF) radio stations are configured to perform long-distance ionospheric radio communications at frequencies within the HF band. However, a range of frequencies over which a HF radio station can perform ionospheric radio communications varies over time due to changes over time in ionospheric propagation conditions and interfering HF communications. In view of the foregoing, a HF radio station cannot listen for calls at a fixed, unchanging frequency, but rather must listen for calls at varying frequencies (i.e., channels) within the HF band. An approach for listening for calls by a HF radio station is known as Automatic Link Establishment (ALE). Under this approach, a plurality of ALE channels that are known to be suitable for ionospheric radio communications are assigned to HF radio stations in a HF radio network for linking between the HF radio stations in the network. However, only a subset of the assigned ALE channels are suitable for linking at any given time, due to changes over time in ionospheric propagation conditions and interfering HF communications. One technique for ensuring that HF radio stations can detect incoming calls at all times is known as scanning ALE. Using this technique, each HF radio station in a HF radio network continuously scans through assigned ALE channels until it detects a possibility of an incoming call from a calling HF radio station. A drawback of this technique is the delay in link establishment between a calling HF radio station and a called HF radio station, since the called HF radio station generally is not monitoring the ALE channel along which the calling HF radio station wishes to transmit, and since the calling HF radio station is generally not aware if the ALE channel along which it wishes to transmit is occupied. This is problematic when HF radio communications are used in environments in which link establishment time is critical. A technique for significantly reducing the time required for link establishment is known as staring ALE. According to this technique, each HF radio station in a staring ALE network has a plurality of parallel receivers configured to continuously monitor a plurality of ALE channels within the HF band for calling signals, the plurality of ALE channels being assigned to the respective HF radio station. The problem with this approach is that the HF radio stations are exposed to strong interfering HF signals throughout the HF band that make it difficult for the HF radio stations to detect faint calls, thereby complicating or preventing the detection of at least some calling signals. There is thus a need in the art for a HF radio station in a staring ALE network with an improved capability for detecting calling signals, while maintaining the fast link establishment that characterizes the staring ALE technique.

Johnson, â\u0080\u009cStaring Link Establishment for High-Frequency Radioâ\u0080\u009d, MILCOM 2015-2015 IEEE Military Communications Conference, pages 1433-1438, investigates the possibility and advantages of using various non-scanning ALE techniques with a new wideband ALE (WALE) to improve spectrum awareness and linking speed. Andree Bengtsson, â\u0080\u009cInstantaneous Channel Access for 3G-ALE Systemsâ\u0080\u009d, published on Aug. 31, 2014, discloses removing a need for a scanning mechanism for radio systems that use a 3G-ALE standard while retaining the capability to handle multiple channels, thereby decreasing latency. This can be accomplished by using a parallel receiver that receives on all the channels in the channel group. Chinese Patent Application Publication No. 101567674A, published on Oct. 28, 2009, discloses a tunable bandpass filter, which adopts a method of the combination of left-handed and right-handed non-linear transmission lines, wherein the left-handed non-linear transmission line consists of a series varactor and a shunt inductor, and has high-pass characteristic; and the right-handed non-linear transmission line consists of a series inductor and parallel varactor, and has low-pass characteristic. The capacitances of the varactors are changed by controlling the bias voltages of the varactors of the left-handed and right-handed non-linear transmission lines so as to adjust lower and upper side frequencies of the bandpass filter respectively. Saha et al., â\u0080\u009cTunable Band-Pass Filter Using RF MEMS Capacitance and Transmission Line, Progress In Electromagnetics Research C, Vol. 23, pages 233-247, 2011, presents the design and fabrication of an RF MEMS tunable band-pass filter. The band-pass filter design uses both distributed transmission lines and RF MEMS capacitances together to replace the lumped elements. The use of RF MEMS variable capacitances gives the flexibility of tuning both the centre frequency and the band-width of the band-pass filter. A prototype of the tunable band-pass filter is realized using parallel plate capacitances. The variable shunt and series capacitances are formed by a combination of parallel plate RF MEMS shunt bridges and series cantilevers. The filter operates at C-X band. The measurement results agree well with the simulation results.

Attention is now drawn to FIG. 1, a schematic illustration of the operation of a staring Automatic Link Establishment (ALE) network 100, in accordance with the presently disclosed subject matter. In accordance with the presently disclosed subject matter, staring ALE network 100 can be configured to include one or more HF base stations 110 (e.g., HF base station 110-a, HF base station 110-b, . . . , HF base station 110-m) and one or more HF mobile radio stations 120 (e.g., HF mobile radio station 120-a, HF mobile radio station 120-b, HF mobile radio station 120-c, . . . , HF mobile radio station 120-n). Each HF mobile radio station 120 can be configured to be capable of two-way communications with one or more of the HF base stations 110. In some cases, at least some of the HF base stations 110 can be connected to one another, as shown in FIG. 1. In some cases, given HF mobile radio stations 120 can be configured to be capable of direct (i.e., not via a HF base station 110) two-way communications with one another (e.g., HF mobile radio stations 120-c and 120-n). In some cases, HF mobile radio stations 120 can be configured to be capable of two-way communications with one another via one or more HF base stations 110. For example, HF mobile radio station 120-c can be configured to be capable of two-way communications with HF mobile radio station 120-a by way of HF base station 110-a. As an additional example, HF mobile radio station 120-n can be configured to be capable of two-way communications with HF mobile radio station 120-a by way of HF base station 110-b and HF base station 110-a. Each user (e.g., user 125-a, user 125-b, user 125-c, . . . , user 125-n) of a respective HF mobile radio station (e.g., 120-a, 120-b, 120-c, . . . , 120-n) can instruct its respective HF mobile radio station 120 to transmit data traffic to another HF mobile radio station 120. Each HF base station 110 and each HF mobile radio station 120 can be configured to include a transceiver, the transceiver including a transmit path and at least one receive path, as detailed further herein, inter alia with reference to FIGS. 2 and 5. The transceiver of each HF base station 110 and each HF mobile radio station 120 can be configured to monitor a plurality of ALE channels assigned for use in the staring ALE network 100 (hereinafter, assigned ALE channels) and to transmit over those ALE channels. Attention is now drawn to FIG. 2, a schematic illustration of an example of a first 10 transceiver 200 for a high frequency (HF) radio station (e.g., a HF mobile radio station 120, a HF base station 110) in a staring ALE network 100, in accordance with the presently disclosed subject matter.

Digital controller 240 can be configured to select the staring frequency band and the assigned ALE channels. The staring frequency band can be a subset of the HF band, the HF band being defined in the present disclosure as the range of radio frequency signals between 1.5 MHz and 30 MHz. The staring frequency band can be selected to improve a detection of incoming calls by the HF radio due to the filtering out of interfering HF signals, while maintaining the fast link establishment that characterizes a HF radio in a staring ALE network 100. In some cases, the staring frequency band and the assigned ALE channels can be selected, at least in part, based on values of parameters that are indicative of ionospheric propagation conditions at a given time, as detailed further herein, inter alia with reference to FIG. 5. In some cases, the staring frequency band and the assigned ALE channels can be selected, at least in part, to prevent one or more expected interfering HF signals from being included within the staring frequency band, as detailed further herein, inter alia with reference to FIG. 5. In some cases, digital controller 240 can be configured to narrow the staring frequency band to prevent one or more actual interfering HF signals from being included within the staring frequency band.

Adjustable-bandwidth tunable bandpass filter 215 can be configured to comprise an adjustable high pass filter (HPF) and an adjustable low pass filter (LPF) connected in series (not shown), wherein the first cut-off frequency of the HPF and the second cut-off frequency of the LPF are configured to be independently adjustable (not shown). This enables the bandwidth of the staring frequency band to be adjusted. The staring frequency band can be adjusted to be between 4% and 100% of the HF band. In some cases, the first cut-off frequency can be one of the following frequencies: 1.5 MHz, 2.43 MHz, 3.7 MHz, 5.6 MHz, 8.5 MHz, 13 MHz and 19.8 MHz. In some cases, the second cut-off frequency can be one of the following frequencies: 2.43 MHz, 3.7 MHz, 5.6 MHz, 8.5 MHz, 13 MHz, 19.8 MHz and 30 MHz.

First receive path 218 can be configured to include, optionally, a low-noise amplifier (LNA) 220. In addition, first receive path 218 can be configured to include a first receive path conversion circuit 223. LNA 220 can be configured to amplify the second HF signals 217 to generate one or more modified HF signals 222. In some cases, LNA 220 can be provided prior to adjustable-bandwidth tunable bandpass filter 215. First receive path conversion circuit 223 can be configured to include a first amplification circuit (AMP) 225, comprising one or more amplifiers, and a first analog-to-digital converter (ADC) 230.

In addition, transmit path 244 can be configured to include, optionally, a HF narrowband tunable bandpass filter 260 coupled between transmitter conversion circuit 250 and power amplifier (PA) 265. Digital controller 240 can be configured to provide, to the modulator 246, one or more digital baseband signals 242 comprising information to be transmitted to another HF radio station (not shown). Modulator 246 can be configured to digitally modulate the digital baseband signals 242, thereby generating one or more digital HF transmission signals 248 having a frequency associated with a given assigned ALE channel of the assigned ALE channels of the HF radio station. Transmitter conversion circuit 250 can be configured to convert the digital HF transmission signals 248 to one or more modified analog HF transmission signals 258. In some cases, transmitter conversion circuit 250 can be configured to include a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) 252 and a transmitter amplifier (AMP-T) 256. DAC 252 can be configured to convert the digital HF transmission signals 248 to one or more analog HF transmission signals 254.

HF narrowband tunable bandpass filter 260 can be configured to pass only HF signals that are transmitted along the given assigned ALE channel. As a result, HF narrowband tunable bandpass filter 260 can be configured to pass the information that is to be transmitted to the another HF radio station while rejecting noise that is present in the modified analog HF transmission signals 258, thereby generating one or more noise-compensated HF transmission signals 262. Digital controller 240 can be configured to tune the HF narrowband tunable bandpass filter 260 to pass only HF signals that are transmitted along the given assigned ALE channel. Power amplifier 265 can be configured to amplify the noise-compensated HF transmission signals 262 or the modified analog HF transmission signals 258 to generate one or more amplified HF transmission signals 267 having enough power to be transmitted to the another HF radio station, via the at least one antenna.

RX/TX switch 275 can also be configured to include an antenna coupler (not shown) to increase the power of the compensated amplified HF transmission signals 272. Attention is now drawn to FIG. 3, a flowchart illustrating an example of a method 300 for a called HF radio station to establish a communication link with a calling HF radio station using the first transceiver 200 schematically illustrated in FIG. 2, in accordance with the presently disclosed subject matter. In accordance with the presently disclosed subject matter, an adjustable-bandwidth tunable bandpass filter 215 of the called HF radio station can be configured to obtain, from (e.g., via) at least one antenna of the called HF radio station, a given analog calling signal that is received from a calling HF radio station, the given analog calling signal being indicative of an incoming call from the calling HF radio station (block 304). The given analog calling signal can be obtained over a given assigned ALE channel of the assigned ALE channels for the called HF radio station. Adjustable-bandwidth tunable bandpass filter 215 can be further configured to provide the given analog calling signal (block 308). Optional low-noise amplifier (LNA) 220 can be configured to amplify the given analog calling signal to generate a given modified calling signal (block 312). First receive path conversion circuit 223 can be configured to convert the given modified calling signal or the given analog calling signal to a given digital calling signal (block 316). A given receiver (e.g., 210-a, 210-b, 210-c, . . . , 210-n), configured to monitor the given assigned ALE channel, can be configured to decode the given digital calling signal (block 320). In response to the given receiver (e.g., 210-a, 210-b, 210-c, . . . , 210-n) decoding the given digital calling signal, the digital controller 240 can be configured, optionally, to narrow the staring frequency band (block 324). In some cases, the staring frequency band can be narrowed to have a passband that is identical to a passband of the given assigned ALE channel over which the given digital calling signal is obtained. By narrowing the staring frequency band, staring receiver 210 can be configured to obtain one or more digital data traffic signals along the given assigned ALE channel from the calling HF radio station, as detailed further herein, inter alia with reference to FIG. 4, while filtering out at least some of the interfering HF signals obtained by first transceiver 200 not along the given assigned ALE channel. Moreover, in response to the given receiver (e.g., 210-a, 210-b, 210-c, . . . , 210-n) decoding the given digital calling signal, the digital controller 240 can be configured to establish a communication link between the called HF radio station and the calling HF radio station by transmitting to the calling HF radio station, via transmit path 244 of the called HF radio station, a digital confirmation signal indicating that the given digital calling signal was decoded (block 328). The specifics of transmit path 244 are detailed earlier herein, inter alia with reference to FIG. 2. Attention is now drawn to FIG. 4, a flowchart illustrating an example of a method 400 for a called HF radio station to decode data traffic signals received from a calling HF radio station using the first transceiver 200 schematically illustrated in FIG. 2, in accordance with the presently disclosed subject matter. In accordance with the presently disclosed subject matter, upon establishment of a communication link between the called HF radio station and the calling HF radio station, as described earlier herein, inter alia with reference to FIG. 3, an adjustable-bandwidth tunable bandpass filter 215 of the called HF radio station can be configured to obtain one or more analog data traffic signals from the calling HF radio station, from (e.g., via) at least one antenna of the called HF radio station, along the given assigned ALE channel (block 404). Adjustable-bandwidth tunable bandpass filter 215 can be configured to provide the analog data traffic signals (block 408). Optional LNA 220 can be configured to amplify the analog data traffic signals to generate one or more modified data traffic signals (block 412). First receive path conversion circuit 223 can be configured to convert the modified data traffic signals or the analog data traffic signals to one or more digital data traffic signals (block 416). A given receiver (e.g., 210-a, 210-b, 210-c, . . . , 210-n), configured to monitor the given assigned ALE channel, can be configured to decode the digital data traffic signals (block 420). Attention is now drawn to FIG. 5, a schematic illustration of an example of a second transceiver 500 for a high frequency (HF) radio station (e.g., a HF mobile radio station 120, a HF base station 110) in a staring ALE network 100, in accordance with the presently disclosed subject matter. In accordance with the presently disclosed subject matter, the second transceiver 500 can be configured to include a staring receiver 510. The staring receiver 510 can be configured to include a plurality of parallel receivers (e.g., receiver 510-a, receiver 510-b, receiver 510-c, . . . , receiver 510-n). The plurality of parallel receivers (e.g., receivers 510-a, 510-b, 510-c, . . . , 510-n) can be configured to simultaneously monitor a corresponding plurality of assigned ALE channels within a staring frequency band for one or more digital control signals, including, inter alia, one or more digital calling signals that are indicative of a corresponding one or more incoming calls to the HF radio station. Each receiver (e.g., 510-a, 510-b, 510-c, . . . , 510-n) of the staring receiver 510 can be configured to decode digital HF signals, whether digital control signals or digital data traffic signals, that are received by the second transceiver 500 along an assigned ALE channel that is monitored by the respective receiver. Second transceiver 500 can be further configured to include a digital controller 550. Digital controller 550 can be one or more processing units (e.g. central processing units), microprocessors, microcontrollers (e.g. microcontroller units (MCUs)) or any other computing devices or modules, including multiple and/or parallel and/or distributed processing units. Digital controller 550 can be configured to select the staring frequency band and the assigned ALE channels. The staring frequency band can be a subset of the HF band. The staring frequency band can be selected to improve a detection of incoming calls by the HF radio due to the filtering out of interfering HF signals, while maintaining the fast link establishment that characterizes a HF radio in a staring ALE network 100. In some cases, the staring frequency band and the assigned ALE channels can be selected, at least in part, based on values of parameters that are indicative of ionospheric propagation conditions at a given time. In some cases, the given time can be a current time, i.e., a time at which the staring frequency band and the assigned ALE channels are selected. In some cases, the given time can be prior to the current time, provided that the ionospheric propagation conditions at the current time are expected to be the same as or similar to the ionospheric propagation conditions at the given time. Selection of the staring frequency band in accordance with ionospheric propagation conditions at the given time improves the detection of incoming calls by the HF radio by filtering out interfering HF signals in parts of the HF band that are not suitable for ionospheric radio communications. The parameters that are indicative of ionospheric propagation conditions can include, but are not limited to, one or more of: a calendar date, a time of day at a geographical location of the HF radio, a time of day at a geographical location of one or more other HF radios in the staring ALE network 100, a geographical location of the HF radio, a geographical location of one or more other HF radios in the staring ALE network 100, or a distance between the HF radio and one or more other HF radios in the staring ALE network 100. In some cases, the staring frequency band and the assigned ALE channels can be selected based on values of parameters that are indicative of ionospheric propagation conditions at the given time, in accordance with an analysis of a quality of signal reception over ALE channels at a plurality of times in the past, the analysis being indicative of a relationship between the parameters and the ionospheric propagation conditions. In some cases, the staring frequency band and the assigned ALE channels can be selected, at least in part, to prevent one or more expected interfering HF signals from being included within the staring frequency band. In some cases, the staring frequency band and the assigned ALE channels can be selected to prevent one or more expected interfering HF signals from being included within the staring frequency band based on an analysis of a quality of signal reception over ALE channels at a plurality of times in the past, the analysis being indicative of the expected interfering HF signals. In some cases, digital controller 550 can be configured to narrow the staring frequency band to prevent one or more actual interfering HF signals from being included within the staring frequency band. As noted inter alia, the bandwidth of the staring frequency band can be adjusted over time. This is very useful in HF ionospheric radio communications since the range of frequencies that can be used by a HF radio station performing HF ionospheric radio communications varies greatly over time in accordance with varying ionospheric propagation conditions over time, such that it is desirable to vary the bandwidth of the staring frequency band over time. Moreover, by enabling adjustment of the staring frequency band over time, the present disclosure enables the exclusion of certain HF interfering signals from the staring frequency band. Second transceiver 500 can be configured to include an adjustable-bandwidth tunable bandpass filter 515. Adjustable-bandwidth tunable bandpass filter 515 can be configured to obtain, from (e.g., via) at least one antenna connected to second transceiver 500, one or more first HF signals 512 within a HF band. Adjustable-bandwidth tunable bandpass filter 515 can be further configured to provide only one or more second HF signals 517 within the staring frequency band. The adjustable-bandwidth tunable bandpass filter 515 can be configured to obtain the first HF signals 512 via a receiver/transmitter (RX/TX) switch (SW) 590 that is connected to the at least one antenna. Adjustable-bandwidth tunable bandpass filter 515 can be configured to comprise an adjustable high pass filter (HPF) and an adjustable low pass filter (LPF) connected in series (not shown), wherein the first cut-off frequency of the HPF and the second cut-off frequency of the LPF are configured to be independently adjustable (not shown). This enables the bandwidth of the staring frequency band to be adjusted, which is of a great benefit in improving reception capability by the HF radio system, as detailed earlier herein, inter alia. The staring frequency band can be adjusted to be between 4% and 100% of the HF band. In some cases, the first cut-off frequency can be one of the following frequencies: 1.5 MHz, 2.43 MHz, 3.7 MHz, 5.6 MHz, 8.5 MHz, 13 MHz and 19.8 MHz. In some cases, the second cut-off frequency can be one of the following frequencies: 2.43 MHz, 3.7 MHz, 5.6 MHz, 8.5 MHz, 13 MHz, 19.8 MHz and 30 MHz. Digital controller 550 can be configured to select the staring frequency band by independently adjusting the first cut-off frequency of the HPF of the adjustable-bandwidth tunable bandpass filter 515 and the second cut-off frequency of the LPF of the adjustable-bandwidth tunable bandpass filter 515.

The first receive path can be configured to include, optionally, a low-noise amplifier (LNA) 520. In addition, first receive path can be configured to include a radio frequency (RF) splitter 525, and a first receive path conversion circuit 530. Low-noise amplifier (LNA) 520 can be configured to amplify the second HF signals 517 to generate one or more modified HF signals 522. In some cases, LNA 520 can be provided prior to adjustable-bandwidth tunable bandpass filter 515. Radio frequency (RF) splitter 525 can be configured to split the modified HF signals 522 or the second HF signals 517 into one or more split HF signals 527. First receive path conversion circuit 530 can be configured to convert split HF signals 527 that are control signals to one or more first digital HF signals 538. In some cases, first receive path conversion circuit 530 can be configured to comprise a first amplification circuit (AMP1) 532, including one or more amplifiers, and a first analog-to-digital converter (ADC1) 536. First amplification circuit 532 can be configured to amplify the split HF signals 527 to generate one or more first amplified HF signals 534. First ADC (ADC1) 536 can be configured to convert the first amplified HF signals 534 to the first digital HF signals 538. Second transceiver 500 can be configured to include a second receive path for processing data traffic signals, the staring receiver 510 being connected to the second receive path. The second receive path can be configured to convert the second HF signals 517 that are data traffic signals to one or more second digital HF signals 548 obtained by the staring receiver 510. In some cases, the second HF signals 517 can include one or more given analog data traffic signals that are received from another HF radio station (i.e., a calling HF radio station), and the second receive path can be configured to convert the given analog data traffic signals to one or more given digital data traffic signals, as detailed further herein, inter alia with reference to FIG. 7. The second receive path can be configured to include the optional low-noise amplifier (LNA) 520, the RF splitter 525, an optional HF narrowband tunable bandpass filter 570, and a second receive path conversion circuit 540. Second receive path can be configured to obtain the second HF signals 517 from adjustable-bandwidth tunable bandpass filter 515. LNA 520 can be configured to amplify the second HF signals 517 to generate one or more modified HF signals 522. RF splitter 525 can be configured to split the modified HF signals 522 or the second HF signals 517 to generate one or more split HF signals 527. Second receive path conversion circuit 540 can be configured to convert split HF signals 527 to one or more second digital HF signals 548. In some cases, second receive path conversion circuit 540 can be configured to comprise a second amplification circuit (AMP2) 542, including one or more amplifiers, and a second ADC (ADC2) 546. Second amplification circuit 542 can be configured to amplify the split HF signals 527 to generate one or more second amplified HF signals 544. Second ADC 546 can be configured to convert the second amplified HF signals 544 to the second digital HF signals 548. In some cases, first amplification circuit 532 can be configured to have a low gain, low levels of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) (even negative SNR) and high selectivity. Conversely, in some cases, second amplification circuit 542 can be configured to have a high gain, high levels of SNR and low selectivity. Put differently, the first amplification circuit 532 can be configured to have a lower gain and SNR than the second amplification circuit 542 and a higher selectivity than the second amplification circuit 542.

                    "Description": "TECHNICAL FIELD This invention relates to therapeutic-agent containing medical devices, and more particularly to medical devices having vapor deposited nanoporous coatings which control therapeutic agent release. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The in-situ presentation and/or delivery of biologically active agents within the body of a patient is common in the practice of modern medicine. In-situ presentation and/or delivery of biologically active agents are often implemented using medical devices that may be temporarily or permanently placed at a target site within the body. These medical devices can be maintained, as required, at their target sites for short or prolonged periods of time, in order to deliver biologically active agent to the target site. Nanoporous materials have the potential to revolutionize drug delivery. For example, iMEDD, Inc. has created silicon membranes with parallel channels ranging from 4 to 50 nm. Diffusion rates of various solutes through such membranes have been measured and conform to zero-order kinetics in some instances (i.e., release is constant with time). In general, drug diffusion rates are expected to decay with time, because the concentration gradient, and thus the driving force for diffusion, is also decaying with time. One explanation for zero order behavior is that, by making the diameter of the nanopores only slightly larger than that of the drug, the nanopores act as bottlenecks, forcing the drugs to proceed in a substantially single-file fashion through the membrane. iMedd claims that the membranes can be engineered to control rates of diffusion by adjusting channel width in relation to the size of solutes. When the proper balance is struck, zero-order diffusion kinetics is possible. iMedd has subsequently produced a drug delivery device which consists of a drug-filled enclosure which is fitted with a nanoporous membrane as the only connection between the internal reservoir of the device and the external medium. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention takes a different approach and is directed to medical devices which comprise the following: (a) an underlying region that comprises a therapeutic agent and (b) a vapor deposited nanoporous coating (e.g., a polymeric, ceramic or metallic nanoporous coating) over the underlying region, which regulates the release of the therapeutic agent from the medical device when it is placed into a subject. In some embodiments, the lateral dimensions of the nanopores within the nanoporous coatings of the present invention are controlled such that they approach the hydrated radius of the biologically active agent. An advantage of the present invention is that medical devices are provided, which release biologically active agents in a highly controlled fashion after administration to a patient, with release profiles approaching zero order release in some instances. These and other embodiments and advantages of the present invention will become immediately apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art upon review of the Detailed Description and claims to follow. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1 is a schematic illustration of a cylindrical pore. DETAILED DESCRIPTION The present invention is directed to medical devices which are adapted for controlled delivery of one or more therapeutic agents. As noted above, the medical devices of the present invention typically comprise the following: (a) an underlying region comprising the one or more therapeutic agents and (b) a vapor deposited nanoporous coating disposed over the underlying region. â\u0080\u009cBiologically active agents,â\u0080\u009d â\u0080\u009cdrugs,â\u0080\u009d â\u0080\u009ctherapeutic agents,â\u0080\u009d â\u0080\u009cpharmaceutically active agents,â\u0080\u009d â\u0080\u009cpharmaceutically active materials,â\u0080\u009d and other related terms may be used interchangeably herein Vapor deposited nanoporous coatings are advantageous for a number of reasons. For example, because they are coatings, certain undesirable properties of the underlying regions, including, for example, tackiness, thrombogenicity and non-optimal vascular compatibility, among others, can be masked by the coatings. Moreover, being vapor deposited, the nanoporous coatings of the invention are also advantageous in various embodiments, because they conform in shape to the underlying layers. Furthermore, in many embodiments, deposition techniques are employed which are not line-of-sight techniques, allowing nanoporous layers to be provided on underlying regions having highly complex three dimensional geometries. Furthermore, because they are nanoporous, the vapor deposited coatings of the invention can be used to control release of therapeutic agents from underlying regions. For example, depending on the pore size, drug delivery devices having parallel or near parallel pore structures (e.g., the iMedd device discussed in the Background of the Invention above) can release therapeutic agent in accordance with a zero order release profile. In certain embodiments of the invention, however, medical devices are provided in which the nanoporous regions are less well defined and in which the therapeutic agent travels through the nanoporous coatings via interconnected networks of nanopores. As long as the interconnected nanopores are of sufficient size and span the thickness of the coating, therapeutic agent can migrate through the coatings. In some instances, the lateral dimensions (e.g., the radii) of the interconnected nanopores approach the lateral dimensions (e.g., the hydrated radius) of the biologically active agent that is being released. Consequently, the agent can move within, and ultimately be released from, pores of these diameters (as opposed to being trapped by pores having smaller diameters). Moreover, the interactions between the biologically active agent and the walls of the nanopores will have a significant effect upon the release profile that is observed. Indeed, as the diameter of the pore approaches the diameter of the agent to be delivered, the surface interactions begin to dominate release rates. See, e.g., Tejal A. Desai, Derek Hansford, â\u0080\u009cMauro Ferrari Characterization of micromachined silicon membranes for immunoisolation and bioseparation applications J. Membrane Science,â\u0080\u009d 159 (1999) 221-231, which describes insulin release through silicone nanomembranes. As with parallel pore structures, the systems of the present invention will release therapeutic agents in a manner that is highly controlled and they have the potential to approach zero order release kinetics. The amount of biologically active agent released and the duration of that release are also affected by the depth and tortuousity of the nanopores within the nanoporous coating. As used herein a â\u0080\u009cnanoporousâ\u0080\u009d coating is one that contains a plurality of nanopores. A â\u0080\u009cnanoporeâ\u0080\u009d is a void having at least one dimension that does not exceed 100 nm in length. Typically nanopores have at least two orthogonal (i.e., perpendicular) dimensions that do not exceed 100 nm and a third orthogonal dimension, which can be greater than 100 nm. By way of example, an idealized cylindrical nanopore is illustrated in FIG. 1. Being a nanopore, the cylindrical pore of FIG. 1 has at least one dimension (in this instance, the orthogonal dimensions â\u0080\u009cxâ\u0080\u009d and â\u0080\u009cyâ\u0080\u009d) that does not exceed 100 nm in length. The third orthogonal dimension â\u0080\u009czâ\u0080\u009d of the cylindrical pore of FIG. 1 can be greater than 100 nm in length. Nanoporous coatings can further comprise pores that are not nanopores. Nanoporous coatings in accordance with the present invention are not limited to any particular material and can be selected from a wide range of vapor deposited nanoporous metallic materials (i.e., materials formed from one or more metals), ceramic materials (i.e., materials formed from one or more ceramic materials), and polymeric materials (i.e., materials containing one or more polymers), including those listed below. Moreover, the nanoporous coatings can cover all or only a portion of the device. One or more nanoporous coating regions can be provided on the medical device surface at desired locations and/or in desired shapes (e.g., in desired patterns, for instance, using appropriate masking techniques, including lithographic techniques). For example, for tubular devices such as stents (which can comprise, for example, a laser or mechanically cut tube, one or more braided, woven, or knitted filaments, etc), nanoporous coating regions can be provided on the luminal surfaces, on the abluminal surfaces, on the lateral surfaces between the luminal and abluminal surfaces, patterned along the luminal or abluminal length of the devices, on the ends, and so forth. Moreover, multiple nanoporous coating regions can be formed using the same or different techniques, and can have the same or differing underlying biologically active agent. It is therefore possible, for example, to release the same or different therapeutic agents at different rates from different locations on the medical device. As another example, it is possible to provide a tubular tubular medical device (e.g., a vascular stent) having a first nanoporous coating disposed over a first biologically active agent (e.g., an antithrombotic agent) at its inner, luminal surface and a second nanoporous coating disposed over a second biologically active agent that differs from the first biologically active agent (e.g., an antiproliferative agent) at its outer, abluminal surface (as well as on the ends). Examples of vapor deposition techniques coatings can be formed over underlying therapeutic-agent-containing regions in accordance with the present invention include physical and chemical vapor deposition techniques. Physical vapor deposition is typically carried out under vacuum (i.e., at pressures that are less than ambient atmospheric pressure). By providing a vacuum environment, the mean free path between collisions of vapor particles (including atoms, molecules, ions, etc.) is increased, and the concentration of gaseous contaminants is reduced, among other effects. Physical vapor deposition (PVD) processes are processes in which a source of material, typically a solid material, is vaporized, and transported to a substrate (which, in accordance with the present invention, comprises one or more therapeutic agents) where a film (i.e., a layer) of the material is formed. PVD processes are generally used to deposit films with thicknesses in the range of a few nanometers to thousands of nanometers, although greater thicknesses are possible. PVD can take place in a wide range of gas pressures, for example, commonly within the range of 10â\u0088\u00925 to 10â\u0088\u00929 Torr. In many embodiments, the pressure associated with PVD techniques is sufficiently low such that little or no collisions occur between the vaporized source material and ambient gas molecules while traveling to the substrate. Hence, the trajectory of the vapor is generally a straight (line-of-sight) trajectory. Some specific PVD methods that are used to form nanoporous coatings in accordance with the present invention include evaporation, sublimation, sputter deposition and laser ablation deposition. For instance, in some embodiments, at least one source material is evaporated or sublimed, and the resultant vapor travels from the source to a substrate, resulting in a deposited layer on the substrate. Examples of sources for these processes include resistively heated sources, heated boats and heated crucibles, among others. Sputter deposition is another PVD process, in which surface atoms or molecules are physically ejected from a surface by bombarding the surface (commonly known as a sputter target) with high-energy ions. As above, the resultant vapor travels from the source to the substrate where it is deposited. Ions for sputtering can be produced using a variety of techniques, including arc formation (e.g., diode sputtering), transverse magnetic fields (e.g., magnetron sputtering), and extraction from glow discharges (e.g., ion beam sputtering), among others. One commonly used sputter source is the planar magnetron, in which a plasma is magnetically confined close to the target surface and ions are accelerated from the plasma to the target surface. Laser ablation deposition is yet another PVD process, which is similar to sputter deposition, except that vaporized material is produced by directing laser radiation (e.g., pulsed laser radiation), rather than high-energy ions, onto a source material (typically referred to as a target). The vaporized source material is subsequently deposited on the substrate. In general, films grown at lower temperatures (e.g., where the ratio of the temperature of the substrate, Ts, relative to the melting point of the deposited of the film, Tm, is less than 0.3) produces films that tend to be more porous than films produced at higher temperatures. See http://lpcm.esm.psu.edu/Ë\u009ctjy107/research.html. Further information regarding PVD can be found in Handbook of Nanophase and Nanostructured Materials. Vol. 1. Synthesis. Zhong Lin Wang, Yi Liu, and Ze Zhang, Editors; Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, Chapter 9, â\u0080\u009cNanostructured Films and Coating by Evaporation, Sputtering, Thermal Spraying, Electro- and Electroless Depositionâ\u0080\u009d. Other aspects of the invention involve the use of chemical vapor deposition (CVD) to produce nanoporous coatings on substrates (which, in accordance with the present invention, include one or more therapeutic agents). CVD is a process whereby atoms or molecules are deposited in association with a chemical reaction (e.g., a reduction reaction, an oxidation reaction, a decomposition reaction, etc.) of vapor-phase precursor species. When the pressure is less than atmospheric pressure, CVD processes are sometimes referred to as low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) processes. Plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) techniques are chemical vapor deposition techniques in which a plasma is employed such that the precursor gas is at least partially ionized, thereby typically reducing the temperature that is required for chemical reaction. Unlike physical vapor deposition processes above, chemical vapor deposition processes are not necessarily line-of-site processes, allowing coatings to be formed on substrates of complex geometry. Several examples by which nanoporous polymer films are deposited by chemical vapor deposition techniques follow. For instance, it is known to deposit nanoporous silicon dielectric films (e.g., silicon oxide films such as silicon dioxide) by PECVD using organosilicate precursor compounds such as tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS), typically in the presence of an oxidant such as N2O, O2, O3, H2O2, etc. See e.g., United States Patent Application No. 2002/0142579 to Vincent et al. As another example, it is known to deposit nanoporous silicon oxycarbide films (specifically SiOCH, also known as hydrogenated silicon oxycarbide) by PECVD oxidation of (CH3)3SiH in the presence of an oxidant (i.e., N2O). See, e.g., D. Shamiryan et al., â\u0080\u009cComparative study of SiOCH low-k films with varied porosity interacting with etching and cleaning plasma,â\u0080\u009d J. Vac. Sci. Technol. B, 20(5), September/October 2002, pp. 1923-1928. As yet another example, in hot-filament CVD, also known as pyrolytic CVD or hot-wire CVD), a precursor gas is thermally decomposed by a source of heat such as a filament. The resulting pyrolysis products then adsorb onto a substrate maintained at a lower temperature (typically around room temperature) and react to form a film. One advantage associated with pyrolytic CVD is that the underlying substrate can be maintained at or near room temperature. As a result, films can be deposited over underlying regions that comprise a wide range of therapeutic agents, including many therapeutic agents that cannot survive other higher-temperature processes due to their thermal sensitivities. For example, in some embodiments, a fluorocarbon polymer film is prepared by exposing a fluorocarbon monomer (e.g., hexafluoropropylene oxide, among others) to a source of heat having a temperature sufficient to pyrolyze the monomer and produce a reactive species that promotes polymerization. By maintaining the substrate region in the vicinity of the reactive species and maintaining the substrate region at a substantially lower temperature than that of the heat source, deposition and polymerization of the reactive species on the structure surface are induced. In other embodiments, fluorocarbon-organosilicon copolymer films are prepared by exposing a fluorocarbon monomer (e.g., hexafluoropropylene oxide, among others) and an organosilicon monomer (e.g., hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane or octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane, among others) to the heat source. Due to the nucleation and growth mechanisms in the HFCVD processes, nanoporous films can be made using HFCVD.

Using the above and other vapor deposition techniques, nanoporous coatings can be formed over a wide range therapeutic-agent-containing regions. For instance, in some embodiments, a nanoporous coating is formed over an underlying region that comprises one or more therapeutic agents dispersed within a support material, for example, within a polymeric, ceramic or metallic support material. In other embodiments, a nanoporous coating is formed over an underlying region that includes (a) a layer that comprises one or more therapeutic-agents and, optionally, one or more additional materials (e.g., a polymeric, ceramic or metallic materials), which is disposed over (b) an underlying support material. Support materials include the metallic, ceramic and polymeric materials. In certain beneficial embodiments, the one or more therapeutic agents are disposed within a polymeric region, for example, within a polymeric support material or within a polymeric layer that is disposed over a support material. Various polymers from which polymeric regions can be formed are listed below. Numerous techniques are available for forming polymeric regions, including thermoplastic and solvent based techniques. For example, where the polymer (or polymers) selected to form the polymeric region have thermoplastic characteristics, a variety of standard thermoplastic processing techniques can be used to form the same, including compression molding, injection molding, blow molding, spinning, vacuum forming and calendaring, as well as extrusion into sheets, fibers, rods, tubes and other cross-sectional profiles of various lengths. Using these and other techniques, entire devices or portions thereof can be made. For example, an entire stent can be extruded using the above techniques. As another example, a coating can be provided by extruding a coating layer onto a pre-existing stent. As yet another example, a coating can be co-extruded with an underlying stent body. If the therapeutic agent is stable at processing temperatures, then it can be combined with the polymer(s) prior to thermoplastic processing. If not, then is can be added to a preexisting polymer region, for example, as discussed below. When using solvent-based techniques to provide one or more therapeutic agents within a polymeric region, the polymer(s) are first dissolved or dispersed in a solvent system and the resulting mixture is subsequently used to form the polymeric region. The solvent system that is selected will typically contain one or more solvent species. The solvent system preferably is a good solvent for the polymer(s) and, where included, for the therapeutic agent(s) as well. Preferred solvent-based techniques include, but are not limited to, solvent casting techniques, spin coating techniques, web coating techniques, solvent spraying techniques, dipping techniques, techniques involving coating via mechanical suspension including air suspension, ink jet techniques, electrostatic techniques, and combinations of these processes. In certain embodiments, a mixture containing solvent, polymer(s) and, optionally, therapeutic agent(s), is applied to a substrate to form a polymeric region. For example, the substrate can be all or a portion of an underlying support material (e.g., a metallic implantable or insertable medical device or device portion, such as a stent) to which the polymeric region is applied. On the other hand, the substrate can also be, for example, a removable substrate, such as mold or other template, from which the polymeric region is removed after solvent elimination. In still other techniques, for example, fiber forming techniques, the polymeric region is formed without the aid of a substrate. In certain embodiments of the invention, the therapeutic agent is dissolved or dispersed in the polymer/solvent mixture, and hence co-established with the polymeric region. In certain other embodiments, the therapeutic agent is dissolved or dispersed within a solvent, and the resulting solution contacted with a previously formed polymeric region to incorporate the therapeutic agent into the polymeric region. As noted above, metallic, ceramic and polymeric materials are used for the formation of various components of the present invention, including, for example, vapor deposited nanoporous coatings as well as various underlying regions, including support regions and layers disposed over support regions.

No. 13/725,862, filed Dec. 21, 2012, and entitled SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR LINK ADAPTATION FOR VARIABLE LINK CONDITIONS, now U.S. Pat.

No. 8,340,586, issued Dec. 25, 2012 and both of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. TECHNICAL FIELD The present disclosure is generally related to the field of data transmission and data coding, for example, in a wireless communications system. BACKGROUND Communications systems, including wireless communications systems, typically communicate through non-ideal channels. For example, conditions such as electromagnetic interference, signal degradation, phase delays, component mismatches, fading, and other circuit and/or environmental non-idealities may attenuate or distort a communications signal or may otherwise interfere with the communications capabilities of the system. Moreover, compensating for these and other channel non-idealities is complicated by the dynamic variation that is often associated with many of these factors. Communications systems may employ link adaptation technologies to adjust communications parameters based on variations of communications channel condition values. For example, link adaptation may be employed in conjunction with many wired and/or wireless communications systems or standards such as Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS), Long Term Evolution (LTE), Enhanced Data GSM Environment (EDGE), Digital Subscriber Line (DSL), Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification (DOCSIS), proprietary systems or protocols, and/or the like. In these and other systems, link adaptation may be employed to adjust parameters such as transmitter output power, receiver input sensitivity, strength of channel coding, symbol rate, allocated spectrum, modulation type, and/or the like in response to channel condition values. In one example, link adaptation is employed to increase the strength of channel coding when communicating through a relatively noisy channel and to decrease the strength of channel coding when communicating through a relatively noise free channel. In this example, the strength of the channel coding may be adjusted to balance the transmission rate of payload data with the ability of the receiver to recover the payload data from the non-ideal channel. In such a manner, link adaptation may be employed to improve the throughput of payload data over a wide range of channel conditions. Additional details regarding link adaptation may be as described by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) technical specification (TS), which is hereby incorporated by reference. For example, TS 25.212, TS 25.308, and TS 25.321 provide additional details regarding link adaptation.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION Overview The following description provides specific details for a thorough understanding of, and enabling description for, various examples of the technology. One skilled in the art will understand that the technology may be practiced without many of these details. In some instances, well-known structures and functions have not been shown or described in detail to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the description of the examples of the technology. It is intended that the terminology used in the description presented below be interpreted in its broadest reasonable manner, even though it is being used in conjunction with a detailed description of certain examples of the technology. Although certain terms may be emphasized below, any terminology intended to be interpreted in any restricted manner will be overtly and specifically defined as such in this Detailed Description section. Technology for performing link adaptation in a communications system is described. The technology may employ an error rate table that has a channel condition value dimension and a transmission parameter dimension. For example, the error rate table may be a memory based table and/or predictive in nature. For example, the error rate table may be employed to enable predictive determination of expected throughputs for given channel conditions. The elements of the error rate table may include expected error rates for data transmitted at various channel conditions according to various transmission parameters. Also, the various transmission parameters may each be associated with a data transmission rate. For a given channel condition value, the methods may determine expected throughputs for each of the transmission parameters according to the associated expected error rates and data transmission rates. A transmission parameter may be selected according to the expected throughputs. As a non-limiting example, the technology may be employed to perform link adaptation in a wireless communications system to adapt a communications link to current channel conditions of a variable condition channel. The technology may also be employed to optimize throughputs, data recoverability, and/or other performance characteristics of the communications system. Further, increases in communications system memory resources may enable implementation of the technology to provide link adaptation superior to conventional link adaptation methods and algorithms. As another example, the technology may be employed with High Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA) or High Speed Uplink Packet Access (HSUPA) systems to select a transport block size (TBS) value according to a determined channel quality indicator (CQI). In such an environment, each TBS value may also be associated with a payload data size as well as a forward error correction (FEC) code strength for each transmitted data block. In this example, the technology enables the likelihood of successful payload data recovery for a particular transmission to be balanced with the size of the payload data. For example, feedback and/or memory of outcomes for transmissions at various TBS values may be stored in an error rate table and employed to select TBS values. Accordingly, data may be transmitted with the TBS value expected to provide the highest throughput. This Detailed Description describes illustrative environments in which the invention may be practiced, illustrative diagrams of a communications system, and illustrative logical flow diagrams for practicing the invention. Illustrative Environments FIG. 1 is a diagram of environment 100 in which the invention may be practiced. As shown, environment 100 includes cell site 110, and mobile devices 150-170. Cell site 110 is coupled to backend interface 140. Cell site 110 and mobile devices 150-170 are configured to communicate with each other over a wireless communications link. Cell site 110 may include virtually any device for facilitating wireless network access. For example, cell site 110 may be a wireless telephony base station, a wireless network access base station, a wireless email base station, and/or the like. As an example, cell site 110 may be operated by a mobile telephony service provider. Generally, cell site 110 is configured to provide a network interface for mobile devices 150-170 by providing an interface (via an antenna) between mobile devices 150-170 and backend interface 140. Cell site 110 and mobile devices 150-170 may communicate using any wireless protocol or standard. These include, for example, Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM), General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), EDGE, Advanced Mobile Phone System (AMPS), Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX), UMTS, Evolution-Data Optimized (EVDO), LTE, Ultra Mobile Broadband (UMB), and/or the like. Backend interface 140 may provide a network connection to cell site 110. For example, backend interface 140 may include one or more T-1 connections, T-3 connections, OC-3 connections, frame relay connections, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) connections, microwave connections, Ethernet connections, and/or the like. In addition, backend interface 140 may provide an interface to a telephone switch (e.g., to a 5ESS switch, a Private Branch Exchange switch, a base station controller, etc.), to a data network (e.g., to a router, network switch, a Radio Network Controller (RNC)), and/or the like. Cell site 110 may also include an antenna to facilitate communications with mobile devices 150-170 over an air interface channel. Such an antenna may include any type of suitable antenna. For example, omnidirectional antennas, lossy transmission lines, beam steerable antennas, variable gain antennas, and/or the like may be employed as appropriate. Cell site 110 may also include a preamplifier (not shown) to preamplify received signals and/or be coupled to any number of antennas. For example, a typical cell site may provide coverage to three sectors of approximately 120Â° each with one or more antennas providing coverage to each sector. However, in other systems, any other number of antennas and/or sectors may be employed. As one example, an air interface channel may include a forward channel and a reverse channel. In one system, downlink transmissions, responses to uplink transmissions (e.g., acknowledgements (ACKs)/negative acknowledgements (NACKs)), control communications, channel condition data or values, and/or the like may be communicated over the forward channel. Likewise, uplink transmissions, responses to downlink transmissions, control communications, channel condition data or values, and/or the like may be communicated over the reverse channel. Also, a picocell may be communicatively coupled to cell site 110 or employed instead of cell site 110. For example, a picocell may be a wireless access point typically covering a relatively small area, such as within a building (e.g., home, office, shopping mall, train station, or the like) or within an aircraft, ship, train or other vehicle. A picocell may, for example, be analogous to a WiFi access point, except that it typically communicates over licensed spectrum of an associated wireless carrier. A picocell may serve as an access point for routing communication between mobile devices 150-170 and other network devices. One or more picocells may be coupled to cell site 110 or other network elements by way of a wired or wireless connection. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the relevant art that picocell implementations of the invention are within the scope of aspects of the invention disclosed herein. Likewise, Internet Protocol (IP) based network implementations of the invention are also within the scope of aspects of the invention disclosed herein. Such IP-based network implementations may take the form of a Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) broadcast architecture, Unlicensed Mobile Access (UMA) or Generic Access Network (GAN) broadcast architecture, or a femtocell broadcast architecture. As used herein, VoIP is a telecommunication system for the transmission of voice over the Internet or other packet-switched networks, UMA is the commercial name of the 3GPP Generic Access Network or GAN standard. Somewhat like VoIP, UMA/GAN is a telecommunication system which extends services, voice, data, and IP Multimedia Subsystem/Session Initiation Protocol (IMS/SIP) applications over IP-based networks. For example, a common application of UMA/GAN is in a dual-mode handset service in which device users can seamlessly roam and handover between local area networks and wide area networks using a GSM/WiFi dual-mode mobile phone. UMA/GAN enables the convergence of mobile, fixed and Internet telephony, sometimes called Fixed Mobile Convergence. Femtocells, much like picocells, may communicate within the licensed spectrum of a wireless carrier. Femtocells may be, for example, designed for use in residential or small business environments. Femtocells may also connect to the service provider's network much like UMA/GAN access points, namely over IP-based networks. Mobile devices 150-170 may include virtually any devices for communicating over a wireless network. For example, mobile devices 150-170 may include mobile telephones (e.g., cellular telephones, GSM telephones, TDMA telephones, LTE telephones, etc.), wireless data devices (e.g., Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), computers, pagers, etc.), and/or the like. Mobile devices 150-170 may also be configured to receive data from cell site 110 and provide a response to cell site 110 to indicate successful and/or unsuccessful reception of the received data. For example, mobile devices 150-170 may be configured to receive encoded data from cell site 110, decode or attempt to decode the data, and provide a response (e.g., ACK/NACK) to cell site 110 to indicate whether the data was successfully decoded. As one example, the invention may be practiced to facilitate communications between cell site 110 and mobile devices 150-170 over the air interface channel. For example, cell site 110 may employ error rate data to determine a transmission parameter for data transmission. Such error rate data may include a channel condition value dimension as well as a transmission parameter dimension and may be stored in an error rate table, error rate array, other data structure, and/or the like (â\u0080\u009cerror rate tableâ\u0080\u009d). Cell site 110 may determine the channel condition to mobile devices 150-170 and then determine a transmission parameter based on the channel condition value and the error rate data. Also, cell site 110 may select the transmission parameter expected to provide the highest expected throughput. Also, cell site 110 may be configured to update/maintain the error rate table based on transmitted blocks. Further details regarding error rate tables are provided below. However, in other example, other devices may be employed to determine a channel condition, determine the transmission parameter, and/or employ an error rate table. For instance, such functionality may be implemented by mobile devices 150-170, a RNC, a switch, and/or the like. In this example, the channel condition value may be quantified by a CQI value or a carrier to interference ratio (C/I). However, in other examples, a signal to noise ratio (SNR), a received signal strength indicator (RSSI) value, a bit error rate (BER), a frame error rate (FER), and/or the like may also be suitably employed. Likewise, the transmission parameter may correspond to a TBS value, a channel coding and/or FEC code strength, a radio frequency (RF) level, a modulation type, and/or the like. The error rate data may represent a bit error rate (BER), a frame error rate (FER), a ratio of NACKs to ACKs, a ratio of successfully decoded data blocks to transmitted data blocks, and/or the like. In an example UMTS environment, each TBS value may correspond to a number of bits of payload data in a transport block, where the number of bits in the transport block may also be inversely related to a channel coding or forward error correction (FEC) code strength of the transport block. In this example, when cell site 110 and a mobile device communicate over a favorable channel (e.g., having a high CQI), cell site 110 may select a transmission parameter that provides a relatively high data transmission rate (e.g., large TBS value). However, if the channel between cell site 110 and another mobile device is less favorable (e.g., lower CQI), cell site 110 may select a transmission parameter that provides a lower data transmission rate (e.g., smaller TBS value). Cell site 110 may also select a transmission parameter to balance the data transmission rate with the likelihood of successful data reception. Accordingly, link adaptation may be performed to select a transmission parameter that optimizes throughput between cell site 110 and each of mobile devices 150-170. However, as discussed above, other devices may be employed to select transmission parameters. In other UMTS or non-UMTS environments other channel condition values and/or transmission parameters, such as those discussed above, may be employed. For example, transmission parameters may also represent modulation types such as Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK), 16 Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (16 QAM), Frequency Modulation (FM), OFDM modulation, wavelet modulation, and/or the like. In such an example, a communications system may employ lower order modulation during less favorable channel conditions and higher order modulation during more favorable channel conditions. Likewise, combinations of the various transmission parameter types may be combined. For example, low order modulation (e.g., QPSK) may be employed with relatively low TBS values while higher order modulation (e.g., 16 QAM) may be employed with higher TBS values. Also, this link adaptation may be performed for the uplink, for the downlink, or for both the uplink and the downlink of a bidirectional communications system. However, in one example, only downlink link adaptation is performed. One skilled in the art will appreciate that although illustrated in the context of a wireless telecommunications environment, the described technology may be practiced in any other communications system or environment. For example, the described technology may be practiced in other wireless communications systems, wired communications system, optical communications systems, and/or the like. Illustrative Communications System FIG. 2 is a block diagram of communications system 290. Communications system 290 includes cell site 110, Base Station Controller (BSC) 242, RNC 244, and switch 246. Cell site 110 includes cell site voice controller 212, cell site data controller 220, and radio/antenna interface 214. Although elements of communications system 290 are illustrated as elements of a GSM/UMTS communications system, the invention is not limited to GSM/UMTS communications systems. For example, the invention may also be practiced in an LTE and/or other fourth generation wireless environment. Switch 246 may be coupled to BSC 242 and RNC 244. For example, switch 246 may be configured to switch voice traffic from one or more BSCs to a public switched telephone network (PSTN) or to a telephone switch such as a 5ESS switch, a Private Branch Exchange switch, and/or the like via signal VOICE. Likewise, switch 246 may be further configured to switch data from one or more RNCs to a data network, to a router, to a switch, and/or the like via signal DATA. Also, switch 246 may include a mobile switching center (MSC), a media gateway, a call gateway, and/or the like. BSC 242 may be coupled between switch 246 and cell site 110 to control certain operational aspects of cell site voice controller 212 of cell site 110. For example, BSC 242 may be configured to control handoffs, network registration for mobile devices, channel allocation, radio transmitter output power, and/or the like. BSC 242 may be employed to control voice functionality of any number of cell sites. RNC 244 may be coupled between switch 246 and cell site 110 to control certain operational aspects of cell site data controller 220 of cell site 110. Also, RNC 244 may be employed to control any number of cell site data controllers. As an example, RNC 244 may be a UMTS counterpart of BSC 242. As stated above, cell site 110 may include cell site voice controller 212, cell site data controller 220, and radio/antenna interface 214. In typical communications systems, cell site voice controller 212 and cell site data controller 220 are configured to provide a low-level radio or air interface to mobile devices under the control of BSC 242 and RNC 244. In one environment, cell site voice controller 212 may be a GSM base station (BS) and cell site data controller 220 may be a UMTS Node-B. In such an environment, cell site voice controller 212 may provide low-level GSM radio interfacing while cell site data controller 220 provides low-level UMTS radio interfacing, fast scheduling, and link adaptation based on channel conditions and error rate data, as discussed above. However, fast scheduling and link adaptation may be provided by or at other elements and/or devices. However, cell site 110 may include limited command and control functionality or no command and control functionality. Instead, BSC 242 and/or RNC 244 may provide such functionality while cell site 110 merely provides a physical layer interface to associated mobile devices. Cell site 110 may also include radio/antenna interface 214 to provide an interface between cell site voice controller 212, cell site data controller 220, and one or more antennas. Radio/antenna interface 214 may include radio frequency (RF) transmitters, receivers, and a smart bias tee that is configured to physically interface the RF signals between cell site voice controller 212, cell site data controller 220, and the one or more antennas. For example, an RF transmitter may be configured to transmit data through a communications channel to a mobile device, and an RF receiver may be configured to receive data from a mobile device. In addition, the received data may include responses to transmitted data, e.g., ACKs and/or NACKs. In other examples, the RF transmitters and/or receivers may alternatively be integrated with cell site voice controller 212 and/or cell site data controller 220 instead of being integrated with radio/antenna interface 214. FIG. 3 is a block diagram of cell site data controller 220. Cell site data controller 220 includes memory 322, channel analyzer 324, data encoder 326, and error rate table manager 328. Memory 322 includes error rate table 323. As discussed above, cell site data controller 220 may be configured to provide low level mobile device data interfacing, fast scheduling, and link adaptation. Memory 322 may be provided to store instructions and/or other data employed by cell site data controller 220. In one example of cell site data controller 220, memory 322 includes error rate table 323, a basic input/output system (BIOS), and application code. As one example, error rate table 323 may be a memory based table and/or predictive in nature. Also, error rate table 323 may have a channel condition value dimension and a transmission parameter dimension, as noted above. Each dimension of error rate table 323 may include multiple values/parameters such that error rate table 323 includes at least four elements (e.g., the possible combinations when two channel condition values and two transmission parameters are employed) with each of the elements corresponding to a channel condition value/transmission parameter combination. Each of these elements may include, for example, an expected error rate, past error rate, other error rate, and/or the like for data transmitted through a communications channel of the corresponding channel condition value and according to the corresponding transmission parameter. In addition, each element may also include additional data (e.g., a number of transmitted data blocks, a number of ACKs, a number of NACKs, and/or the like and combinations thereof). Further, each of the transmission parameters may be associated with an estimated or actual data transmission rate (e.g., number of bits, bit rate, frame rate, etc.). Accordingly, throughput may be determined as a function of the error rate and the data transmission rate, for example, by data encoder 326, as discussed below. One example of a suitable error rate table is illustrated below by FIG. 4. Channel analyzer 324 may be configured to determine a condition of the communications channel (e.g., channel quality, signal strength, fading, etc.) and to select one of the channel condition values from the channel condition value dimension of error rate table 323 according to the condition of the communications channel. For example, channel analyzer 324 may be configured to select the channel condition value according to a current, past, or predicted quality of the communications channel. Also, channel analyzer 324 may determine a CQI according to a SNR, BER, FER, and/or the like. Likewise, channel analyzer 324 may be adapted to receive CQI information from a mobile device or may be integrated within a mobile device. However, any other suitable channel analyzers may be employed. Data encoder 326 may be configured to determine the transmission parameter for data transmission and to encode and/or transmit data according to the determined transmission parameter. For example, data encoder 326 may analyze error rate table 323 to determine the expected error rates for each channel condition value/transmission parameter combination having the channel condition value selected by channel analyzer 324. Data encoder 326 may then calculate expected throughput for each transmission parameter according to these expected error rates and estimated or actual data transmission rates for each transmission parameter. For example, the expected throughput may be calculated as (1â\u0088\u0092Er)*Tr, where Er is an expected error rate and Tr is the estimated or actual transmission rate. With this example, the error rate may be a percentage of transmission blocks expected to be unrecoverable or received with uncorrectable errors. Data encoder 326 may also be configured to select the transmission parameter according to the expected throughput. For example, data encoder 326 may be configured to select the transmission parameter corresponding to the highest calculated expected throughput. Data encoder 326 may then encode and/or transmit data according to the selected transmission parameter. Error rate table manager 328 may be provided to initialize, update, maintain, and/or provide error rate table 323. In at least one system, error rate table manager 328 is a real-time or near real-time system or process. However, other error rate table managers may include non-real-time systems or processes. As one example, error rate table manager 328 may be configured to initialize error rate table 323. Initialization may include initializing error rate table 323 with zeros, ones, and/or estimated error rates. For example, estimated error rates may be based on simulation data for a variety of channel conditions/transmission parameter combinations. As another example, estimated error rates may also include experimental or test data (e.g., for a particular specific region, rural regions, urban regions, for a specific cell site, etc.). As yet another example, cell site data controller 220 may be configured to transmit a training sequence to a mobile device as part of an initialization sequence for error rate table 323. For example, a suitable training sequence may include blocks transmitted over a variety of channel conditions and with a variety of transmission parameters. However, as discussed below, a training sequence is not required as error rate table 323 may quickly converge during operation. In addition, error rate table manager 328 may also be configured to update and/or maintain error rate table 323 based on ongoing communications. For example, error rate table manager 328 may receive indications of whether transmitted blocks are successfully received (e.g., an ACK or NACK). Based on this indication, error rate table manager 328 may update the error rate element of the corresponding channel condition value/transmission parameter combination (e.g., lower the corresponding error rate element as NACKs are received). However, error rate table manager 328 may also update corresponding error rate elements of error rate table 323 according to a ratio of ACKs to transmitted blocks, a ratio of NACKs to transmitted blocks, and/or the like. In one example, blocks are transmitted every two milliseconds (e.g., a transmission time interval (TTI) of two milliseconds) and an ACK or NACK should be received a few milliseconds after each transmission. In such a system, the described link adaptation will update error rate table 323 with 500 indications a second. Accordingly, the expected error rates for a current channel condition will quickly converge and enable efficient optimization of throughput even with dynamic channel conditions. In addition, error rate table manager 328 may be further configured to manage moving averages for the error rates of error rate table 323. For example, moving averages may be employed due to dynamic channel conditions that may render old indications irrelevant to current channel conditions. In one environment, moving averages may be calculated such that the most recent number of N samples are employed to calculate an error rate for each error rate element. For example, as each additional value for channel condition/transmission parameter is acquired, the oldest sample is discarded and the additional value is stored. The error rate element may then be recalculated. However, a moving average may also be calculated for a time period, e.g., a 10- to 30-second window time frame. However, any other suitable time frame may be employed. In another example, error rate table manager 328 is configured to dynamically adjust a moving average time frame according to mobile device conditions. For example, a shorter timeframe may be employed with a fast-moving mobile device while a longer time frame may be employed with a relatively immobile mobile device. FIG. 4 is an illustration of an example of error rate table 323. As shown, error rate table 323 includes channel condition value dimension 410, transmission parameter dimension 420, and error rate elements 430. Channel condition value dimension 410 includes channel condition values 412, and transmission parameter dimension 420 includes transmission parameters 422. As shown, each of error rate elements 430 corresponds to a channel condition value and a transmission parameter. FIG. 4 is provided merely to illustrate a possible example of an error rate table 323. In this example, the â\u0080\u009c0.01â\u0080\u009d values may represent initialization values for channel condition/transmission parameter combinations for which no empirical data is available. However, for other examples, a â\u0080\u009c0.00,â\u0080\u009d â\u0080\u009c1.00,â\u0080\u009d or any other suitable value may be employed as initialization values. Likewise, the values, parameters, and error rate data of FIG. 4 do not necessarily represent actual values, parameters, and error rate data. However, in real-world operations, a diagonal set of error rate elements 430 may be most likely to converge (e.g., to cause use of large TBS values at high CQI conditions and small TBS values at low CQI conditions). Initializing, updating, maintaining, and/or providing error rate table 323 may be as discussed above in reference to error rate table manager 328. As one example, channel condition values 412 may correspond to CQI values, transmission parameters 422 may correspond to TBS values, and error rate elements 430 may represent percentage likelihoods (e.g., probability values) that a block transmitted into a channel of a corresponding CQI with a corresponding TBS will be recovered. With this example, an expected throughput is (TBS*PI), where TBS is the number of bits in a block and PI is the percentage likelihood of block recovery for the corresponding channel condition value/transmission parameter combination. For example, at a CQI of 14, the expected throughput for a 2046 bit TBS is 2005 bits, the expected throughput for a 2404 bit TBS is 2236 bits, and the expected throughput for a 2726 bit TBS is 2208 bits. With this example, a TBS of 2404 may be selected to optimize the expected throughput. Also, if all transmission parameters are the same or uninitialized for a given channel condition value, a data encoder may be configured to select a transmission parameter according to a tie-breaking mechanism. For example, the data encoder may select the transmission parameter with the highest associated data transmission rate. As another example, each of error rate elements 430 may represent discount values (e.g., the likelihood that a transport block of a corresponding transmission parameter transmitted into a channel of a corresponding channel condition value will be unrecoverable or received with uncorrectable errors) for its corresponding channel condition value/transmission parameter combination. Likewise, each of error rate elements 430 may include counters such as ACK counters, NACK counters, transmitted block counters, and/or the like, and combinations thereof, for each channel condition value/transmission parameter combination. These counters may be operated upon to provide probability values or discount values (e.g., divide ACK counters by transmitted block counters to calculate probability values) for its channel condition value/transmission parameter combination. Further details regarding such counters are discussed below in reference to FIG. 5. Illustrative Logical Flow Diagrams FIG. 5 is a logical flow diagram of process 500 for updating an error rate table. Flowing from a start block, processing begins at step 510 where data encoder 326 transmits a block with a channel condition value/transmission parameter combination. As one example, the channel condition value/transmission parameter combination of step 510 is selected by steps 620 and 630 of process 600, as discussed below. Processing then flows to step 520. At decision block 520, error rate table manager 328 determines if an ACK or a NACK is received in response to the transmitted block. For example, an ACK may be transmitted by a mobile device upon receiving and successfully decoding a block from cell site 110. Likewise, a NACK may be transmitted by the mobile device upon receiving a block that it is unable to decode. In one example, a lack of response is considered a NACK. If an ACK is received at decision block 520, processing flows to step 530 where error rate table manager 328 increments an ACK counter and a block counter for the channel condition value/transmission parameter combination of step 510. However, if a NACK is received at decision block 520, processing flows to step 540 where error rate table manager 328 increments the block counter for the channel condition value/transmission parameter combination of step 510 without incrementing corresponding ACK counter. Accordingly, the ratio of the count on the ACK counter to the count of the block counter approximates a percentage of successfully received blocks to transmitted blocks for the channel condition value/transmission parameter combination. From either step 530 or 540, processing flows to step 550 where error rate table manager 328 updates the error rate element 430 of the channel condition value/transmission parameter combination of step 510. Error rate table manager 328 may update the corresponding error rate element 430 by dividing the corresponding ACK counter by the corresponding block counter. Processing then returns to block 510. FIG. 6 is a logical flow diagram of process 600 for link adaptation in a communications system. Flowing from a start block, processing begins at step 610 where cell site data controller 220 provides and/or updates error rate table 323. For example, error rate table manager 328 may be employed to initialize, update, maintain, or otherwise provide error rate table 323. As discussed above, error rate table 323 may be employed to provide dynamic link adaptation and to optimize throughput over varying channel conditions. In addition, use of error rate table 323 may enable improved spectral efficiency of between ten percent to 100 percent as compared to other link adaptation systems, methods, and/or algorithms. From step 610, processing flows to step 620 where channel analyzer 324 selects a channel condition value based on a current channel condition. Channel analyzer 324 may select a channel condition value that best approximates and/or represents a current state of a communications channel between a cell site and mobile device. As one example, channel analyzer 324 selects a CQI value as the channel condition value based on measured or reported values from a mobile device. From step 620, processing flows to step 630 where data encoder 326 selects a transmission parameter according to the channel condition value and error rate table 323. As discussed above, data encoder 326 may select a transmission parameter from transmission parameter dimension 420 to optimize the expected throughput by calculating expected throughput for each transmission parameter given a channel condition value and selecting the transmission parameter corresponding to the highest or â\u0080\u009cbestâ\u0080\u009d expected throughput. Processing then flows to step 640. At step 640, data encoder 326 then transmits a block according to the selected transmission parameter. Information regarding reception of this block may be employed to update error rate table 323 as processing returns to step 610. As described herein, processes 500 and 600 may be implemented in software, in hardware, or in a combination of hardware and software. As such, the operations illustrated as blocks in FIGS. 5 and 6 may respectively represent processor-executable instructions that, when executed, perform link adaptation or direct the updating of an error rate table. For clarity, processes 500 and 600 are described below as being performed by particular elements of FIGS. 1-4. However, processes 500 and/or 600 may also be, for example, performed by other processors, by other elements, or in other systems whether or not such processors, elements, or systems are described herein.

                    "Description": "CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION This application claims the priority benefit of Taiwan application serial no. 87103886, filed Mar. 16, 1998, the full disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention This invention relates to oscillators, and more particularly, to a high-frequency ring oscillator which is constructed from a ring of cascaded delay circuits each being implemented from a CMOS (complementary metal-oxide semiconductor) inverter incorporated with either a positive-feedback gate structure or a positive-feedback drain structure so as to improve the output-to-output characteristics of the ring oscillator. Description of the Related Art A ring oscillator is a circuit that includes a ring of cascaded delay circuits, such as a ring of cascaded inverters, for generating an oscillating signal at a frequency proportional to the magnitude of a control voltage. The overall feedback gain of the cascaded delay circuits should be greater than 1 and inverted in phase. Assume the total number of the cascaded delay circuits is n. If n is very large or the operating frequency is very low, the ring oscillator will operate in a delayed oscillation mode. In this mode, the output frequency fOSC of the ring oscillator is as follows: FOSC =1/[nÂ·(tpHL +tpHL)] where (tpLH +tpHL) is the delay time in each of the cascaded delay circuits. On the other hand, if n is small and the operating frequency is high, the ring oscillator will operate in a phase-shifting sinusoidal oscillation mode. In this mode, the output angular frequency Ï\u0089OSC (where Ï\u0089OCS =2Ï\u0080fOSC) of the ring oscillator will comply with the following Nyquist criteria: |Î²A(Ï\u0089OSC)|=1 Î¸(Ï\u0089OSC)=180Â° where Â Î² is the feedback factor; Â Î²A is loop gain; and Â Î¸ is phase shift. Since Î²=1, the ring oscillator should be designed in such a manner that Aâ\u0089¥1 and Î¸=180Â°/n. The provision of Aâ\u0089¥1 ensures that the ring oscillator can output an oscillating signal. However, if A>1, it will cause the remaining oscillating signal to continuously increase in amplitude until reaching the top and bottom nonlinear regions. In these regions, both the gain and the bandwidth will decrease, causing the oscillating signal to be somewhat distorted in waveform. However, in these regions, the operating mode of the ring oscillator will be close to the delayed oscillation mode, causing the output frequency of the oscillating signal to be decreased slightly. Therefore, the gain should not be designed to be overly large. The delay circuits used in the ring oscillator are best implemented from common source logic (CSL) circuits, such as CSL inverters. A CSL circuit is a differential-type of amplifier. As mentioned above, the CSL circuit should not be overly large in gain near the low-frequency region in order to allow the ring oscillator to generate the highest possible frequency. In high-frequency ring oscillators of more than 1 GHz, since they typically include a lesser number of delay circuits, the output frequency is sinusoidal in waveform rather than a full-swing square waveform. In the case of a 4-stage ring oscillator, for example, the delay circuits are each operated in such a manner that the absolute value of the gain is greater than 1 i.e., |A|>1) for each phase shift of 45Â°. However, when operating under a low working voltage, since the common current source cannot be kept in the saturation mode all the time, the common-mode gain will become the primary factor that affects the output frequency. Therefore, under this condition, the output frequency of the voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) is not be adjusted in a linear manner with the magnitude of the control current. FIG. 1 is a schematic block diagram of a conventional 4-stage ring oscillator. As shown, this conventional ring oscillator includes four cascaded stages of CSL inverters 10, 20, 30, 40, a first CSL buffer 50, a second CSL buffer 60, and a CSL divide-by-2 divider 70. The four CSL inverters 10, 20, 30, 40 are all identical in function and structure as illustrated in FIG. 2. The CSL inverter of FIG. 2 is symmetrical in CMOS configuration, including PMOS transistors P1, P2, and NMOS transistors N1, N2, N3. Further, the CMOS CSL inverter has a positive input port 310, a negative input port 320, a positive outlet port 330, and a negative outlet port 340. A control voltage Vctl is applied to the gate of the NMOS transistor N3. Assume body effect is neglected, then the gain Av and 45-degree phase-shift frequency f-3dB of the CMOS CSL inverter of FIG. 2 can be formulated as follows: (Equation image '1' not included in text) where Vod is output differential voltage; Â Vid is input differential voltage; Â gm N1 is the transconductance of the NMOS transistor N1; Â gm N2 is the transconductance of the NMOS transistor N2; Â VGS N1 is bias to the NMOS transistor N1; Â VtN1 is the threshold voltage of the NMOS transistor N1; Â Î¼N is the carrier mobility of the NMOS transistor; Â Cox is the unit gate capacitance of the NMOS transistor; Â Î» is the channel modulation constant; and Â tp is the main extreme time constant. Assume the 0.5Î¼5.0V2p3m CSL inverter manufactured by the TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacture Corporation) of Taiwan is used to serve as each of the CSL inverters in the ring oscillator of FIG. 1. Assume the common-mode voltage VCM at the differential input of the CSL inverter is VCM =1.2 V (which serves as a DC bias to the CSL inverter). Then, with the first and second CSL buffers 50, 60 and the CSL divide-by-2 divider 80 serving as a load to the cascaded CSL inverters 10, 20, 30, 40, the simulated results of the gain and 45-degree phase-shift frequency f-3dB are shown in the following Table 1. TABLE 1Vctl (volt)1.51.41.31.21.11.00.9Av (times)1.201.161.11.0140.884----f-3dB (GHz)1.351.361.371.391.40----IDS N3 (Î¼A)235219198172135---- From the data shown in Table 1, it can be learned that the prior art of FIGS. 1-2 has the following drawbacks. Â (1) First, it can be seen that the drain-to-source current IDS N3 of the NMOS transistor N3 decreases as the control voltage Vctl at the gate of the NMOS transistor N3 is decreased. However, the 45-degree phase-shift frequency f-3dB increases with the current IDS N3. This is because that as the current IDS N3 decreases, it causes the channel capacitance of the PMOS transistor working in the linear region to be reduced. Moreover the rate of change of the channel capacitance is faster than that of the transconductance. Â (2) Second, as the current IDS N3 decreases, it causes the gain to decrease as well, thus decreasing the amplitude of the output frequency of the ring oscillator. Therefore, the ring oscillator is unable to operate when the control voltage falls below a certain level to generate a low frequency output. Â (3) Third, when the control voltage Vctl is below 1.2 V, the gain is reduced to below 1, which does meet application requirements. Due to the foregoing drawbacks, the conventional ring oscillator is inoperable when the control voltage is reduced to lower than 1.2 V, at which point the gain is reduced to below 1. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is therefore an objective of the present invention to provide a ring oscillator which is designed based on a regeneration logic scheme to allow the ring oscillator to be still operable when the control voltage is reduced to below a certain level. In accordance with the foregoing and other objectives of the present invention, an improved ring oscillator is provided. The ring oscillator of the invention is characterized in that each of the CMOS CSL inverters therein is additionally incorporated with either a positive-feedback gate structure or a positive-feedback drain structure so as to improve the output-to-input characteristics of the ring oscillator. More specifically, the ring oscillator of the invention is still operable and outputs an oscillating signal even though the control voltage falls below a certain level, and at which point the gain is still larger than 1. The invention therefore has the advantage over the prior art both in gain and output-to-input characteristics and is operable over a wide bandwidth of output frequency.

The improvements on the characteristics of the ring oscillator of FIG. 3 over the prior art of FIG. 1 will be described later in this specification. Second Preferred Embodiment FIG. 5 is a schematic block diagram showing the architecture of a second preferred embodiment of the high-frequency ring oscillator according to the invention. In the example of FIG. 5, the number of stages in the ring oscillator is an even number (i.e., 4), but it is to be understood that it also can be an odd number such as 3, 5, or 7. As shown, the ring oscillator of this embodiment includes a ring of four improved delay circuits 210, 220, 230, 240, a first CSL buffer 50, a second CSL buffer 60, and a CSL divide-by-2 divider 70. The ring oscillator of this embodiment is substantially identical in architecture to the prior art of FIG. 1 except that the four delay circuits 210, 220, 230, 240 are here constructed in a different manner, as illustrated in FIG. 6. More specifically, the four delay circuits 210, 220, 230, 240 each include an additional positive-feedback drain structure to the CMOS CSL inverter of FIG. 2. In the delay circuit of FIG. 6, the circuit part that is enclosed in a dashed box indicated by the reference numeral 10 is identical in structure to the conventional CMOS CSL inverter of FIG. 2. In a similar manner, the CMOS CSL inverter 10 includes a positive input port 310, a negative input port 320, a positive output port 330, and a negative output port 340. In addition to the CMOS CSL inverter 10, the improved delay circuit of FIG. 6 includes a first CMOS transistor 250, a second CMOS transistor 260, and a third CMOS transistor 270, which in combination constitute a positive-feedback drain structure for the CMOS CSL inverter 10. The first CMOS transistor 250 is connected in such a manner that its drain is connected to both the positive output port 330 of the CMOS CSL inverter 10 and the gate of the second CMOS transistor 260; its source is connected to the drain of the third CMOS transistor 270; and its gate is connected to the negative output port 340 of the CMOS CSL inverter 10. The second CMOS transistor 260 is connected in such a manner that its drain is connected to both the negative output port 340 of the CMOS CSL inverter 10 and the gate of the first CMOS transistor 250; its source is connected to the drain of the third CMOS transistor 270; and its gate is connected to the positive output port 330 of the CMOS CSL inverter 10. The third CMOS transistor 270 is connected in such a manner that its drain is connected to both the source of the first CMOS transistor 250 and the source of the second CMOS transistor 260; its source is connected to the ground; and its gate is connected to a control voltage 100. Referring back to FIG. 5, the whole circuit of FIG. 6 is utilized to serve as each of the delay circuits 210, 220, 230, 240 in the ring oscillator of this embodiment. The positive input port 310, the negative input port 320, the positive output port 330, and the negative output port 340 of the circuit of FIG. 6 are here designated by 310A, 320A, 330A, and 340A for the first delay circuit 210; by 310B, 320B, 330B, and 340B for the second delay circuit 220; by 310C, 320C, 330C, and 340C for the third delay circuit 230; and by 310D, 320D, 330D, and 340D for the fourth delay circuit 240. In the case of the total number of stages in the ring oscillator of FIG. 5 being an even number, for example 4, the four delay circuits 210, 220, 230, 240 are interconnected in the same manner as the previous embodiment. Therefore, detailed description thereof will not be repeated here. In the case of the total number of stages being an odd number, for example 3, 5, or 7, each adjoining pair of the delay circuits are interconnected in such a manner that the positive output port of the first stage is connected to the negative input port of the next stage, and the twisted connection in the case of even-number of stages is unnecessary. In the case of FIG. 5, for example, the positive output port of the fourth delay circuit 240 is connected to the positive input port of the first delay circuit 210, while the negative output port of the fourth delay circuit 240 is connected to the negative input port of the first delay circuit 210. Therefore, the invention is applicable to ring oscillators with either and even-number stages of delay circuits or an odd-number stages of delay circuits. Furthermore, all of the delay circuits 210, 220, 230, 240 are connected to a common control voltage 100. The first CSL buffer 50 is coupled to the output ports 330A, 340A of the first delay circuit 210, while the second CSL buffer 60 is coupled to the output ports 330C, 340C of the third delay circuit 230. The CSL divide-by-2 divider 70 is coupled to the output ports of the first CSL buffer 50. The first CSL buffer 50 can also check whether the CSL divide-by-2 divider 70 operates normally. Comparison In a simulation test, the first preferred embodiment of FIG. 3 and the second preferred embodiment of FIG. 5 according to the invention are compared with the prior art of FIG. 1 by the TSMC's 0.5Î¼5.0V2p3m process. The output frequency, the amplitude of the outer frequency, and the output current are measured in response to various magnitudes of the control voltage. The resulting data are shown in Table 2.

FIG. 8 is a graph showing the plots of the output frequency versus control voltage characteristics for the three different kinds of ring oscillators, in which the curve 410 is plotted for the first preferred embodiment; the curve 420 is plotted for the second preferred embodiment; and the curve 430 is plotted for the prior art. Moreover, FIG. 9 is a graph showing the plots of the amplitude of the output frequency versus control voltage characteristics for the same three different kinds of ring oscillators, in which the curve 440 is plotted for the first preferred embodiment; the curve 450 is plotted for the second preferred embodiment; and the curve 460 is plotted for the prior art. It can be learned from FIGS. 8-9 as well as from Table 2 that when the control voltage Vctl is reduced to below 1.2 V, no output frequency is generated from the prior art, whereas the first and second preferred embodiments of the invention are still able to allow near-linear output-to-input characteristics when the control voltage Vctl is reduced to below 1.2 V. Moreover, when the control voltage is above 1.2 V, both the first and second embodiments of the invention allow a higher gain (evident form the higher amplitudes) than the prior art. Furthermore, the principle of the regeneration logic scheme for the design of the ring oscillator of the invention is explained in the following with reference to FIGS. 7A-7B. In operation of the ring oscillator of the invention, the relationship of the amplitude of the output frequency to the input control voltage will be subjected to a hysteresis effect whose characteristics curve 400A is shown in FIG. 7A. The area enclosed by the hysteresis curve 400A, as indicated by the reference numeral 400B, is referred to as a hysteresis area. The hysteresis area 400B is equivalent to the clipping of the input control voltage by a clipping circuit, as illustrated in FIG. 7B. The hysteresis area 400B will result in a delay to the transmission of the input control voltage to the differential amplifier of the CMOS CSL inverter. This delay will the substantially affect the output frequency. Therefore, the output frequency can be adjusted by varying the size of the hysteresis area 400B. This scheme has the drawback of attenuating the input control voltage. However, if the input control voltage is greater than the hysteresis area 400B, the gain can be increased due to the regeneration effect. The improvement on the gain factor is evident from FIG. 9 (or Table 2), in that both the first and second preferred embodiments of the invention are seen to have greater amplitude than the prior art. Therefore, the invention is more advantageous in output-to-input characteristics than the prior art, particularly in the low-frequency regions. The invention has been described using exemplary preferred embodiments. However, it is to be understood that the scope of the invention is not limited to the disclosed embodiments. On the contrary, it is intended to cover various modifications and similar arrangements. The scope of the claims, therefore, should be accorded to the broadest interpretation so as to encompass all such modifications and similar arrangements."
