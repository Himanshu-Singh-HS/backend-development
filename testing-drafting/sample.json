        "invention_disclosure": "1. Get 2 raw CIR estimates: one obtained in short-range mode and one in long-range mode. 2. Mix these 2 raw CIR estimates to reconstruct and expose a mixed CIR estimate for which all taps contain a useful signal. The 2 raw CIRs must correspond to the same environmental conditions and thus shall be obtained approximately at the same time. One solution would be to successively transmit 2 frames, one with a low power and one with a high power, and get one CIR per transmitted frame. The preferred solution is to transmit one frame containing an Ipatov and an STS field. The 2 fields are transmitted at different transmit levels, and one gets one CIR estimation per field. Let’s call {𝑟̂𝐻(𝑚, 𝑘)} and {𝑟̂𝐿(𝑚, 𝑘)} the raw CIR estimates obtained respectively from the high and the low power transmitted fields, where 𝑚 and 𝑘 index the slow and fast times, respectively. The purpose here is to define the combining factors 𝛽𝐻(𝑘) and 𝛽𝐿(𝑘) to construct the new CIR 𝑟̃(𝑚, 𝑘) to be exposed as 𝑟̃(𝑚, 𝑘) = 𝛽𝐻(𝑘)𝑟̂𝐻(𝑚, 𝑘) + 𝛽𝐿(𝑘)𝑟̂𝐿(𝑚, 𝑘). To have a noise variance level independent of the tap index is a positive characteristic. When this is not met, it can have an important impact on the post-processing algorithm. Thus, the reconstructed CIR must verify this as much as possible. On the other hand, the combining factors should be defined in such a way that the power of the CIR taps stays linked to the target distance as it is on each raw CIR on the non-saturated taps. The CIR estimates can be divided into 3 sections: 1. From 1 to 𝑘0: The precursor taps, before the spill-over. 2. From 𝑘0 + 1 to 𝑘𝑆: The spill-over taps, i.e., all the taps where the spill-over signal is predominant. This is where the saturated taps are located in long-range mode. 3. From 𝑘𝑆 + 1 to the end: The taps after the spill-over. In the last section, the high-power CIR estimate is not saturated and thus should be preferred to the low-power one, as it has a better SNR. In the second section, the low-power estimate must be used, but the high-power one can also be used to get relevant power. Proposed values for 𝛽𝐻(𝑘) and 𝛽𝐿(𝑘) are as follows: For 𝑘 from 1 to 10, 𝛽𝐻(𝑘) = ¼ and 𝛽𝐿(𝑘) = 1; for 𝑘 from 11 to 15, 𝛽𝐻(𝑘) = ¼ and 𝛽𝐿(𝑘) = ½; for 𝑘 from 16 to 20, 𝛽𝐻(𝑘) = ¼ and 𝛽𝐿(𝑘) = 1/8; and for 𝑘 = 22, 𝛽𝐻(𝑘) = 1 and 𝛽𝐿(𝑘) = 0. To reduce computational complexity, the values of 𝛽𝑋(𝑘) have been selected as powers of 2. Thus, the computation of the mixed coefficients involves just two bit-shifts and one addition.",

A set of data elements from the portion of data elements in the mth location is then selected. Thereafter, each data element in the selected set of data elements is copied to specified data fields located in the corresponding portion, i.e. the mth location, of a destination operand. Note the multiple portions in a data operand may include equal or different number of data elements depending upon the control word. There are two portions, i.e. m=2, of four data elements.

        "invention_disclosure": "The main idea of this invention is to establish a blockchain-based ecosystem that will monetize decentralized power sharing.\nIn this ecosystem, a micro-economy is formed where participants can trade the energy stored in their devices for financial remuneration.\nIn short, we envision the Uber of energy trading. We propose a marketplace whereby users can opt-in to have their mobile devices or any IoT device opt-in and request battery charges (power transfers).\nIncentivized by cryptocurrency-based payments, providers in the ecosystem can opt-in and offer their charging services. Like Uber, a mobile device can request a charge.\nNearby power service providers (users with mobile devices with the ability to transfer power or users with power banks) can offer their services.\nThrough a marketplace, providers and customers can negotiate, bid, and agree on power-for-pay exchanges.\nOnce a power provider delivers charge to the client’s mobile device, either through a power bank or through wireless charging technologies, payment for the service is done through the blockchain backbone using a native cryptocurrency.\n(a) For example, if a device charge level drops below a parametrized threshold level, a request-for-charge (RFC) is automatically submitted to the system.\nFor example, Alice is a participant whose mobile phone battery percentage has recently fallen below a 10% threshold.\nAlice then generates a request for charge indicating that she is willing to pay $0.20/kWh for a minimum 2W charge.\n(b) Alice’s request-for-charge is received by the system and submitted for fulfillment.\nIn the marketplace, various users with varying degrees of excess charge are selling their excess charge directly to each other in a peer-to-peer manner.\nThis arrangement eliminates many features of traditional exchanges, including a bid-ask spread.\n(c) Bob is a participant whose mobile phone is fully charged at 100%. Bob is willing to share 50% of his mobile device charge at 2W for the $0.20/kWh that Alice requested.\n(d) Upon receipt of several bids, Alice selects a winning bid (explicitly or automatically) based on parameterized constraints including cost, and both parties enter into contract on the blockchain for charge delivery (enforced through a smart contract).\n(e) The transaction remains open until the agreed-upon charge level is met, at which point the transaction is closed and finalized on the blockchain.\nIf, for whatever reason, the agreed-upon charge level is not delivered, Alice can independently close out the contract with Bob being charged a pro-rated amount for the charge delivered.",

        "invention_disclosure": "IWMS systems allow users to allocate space to organizations, tied to space use agreements, which tell finance how to subdivide the overall lease costs. This process is known as Chargeback in space and facilities management.\nThe problem however is the lines of business and their need for that space is more organic and fluctuates throughout the year. Meaning that the space which is paid for often goes underutilized and significant cost could be avoided if there were a way to sub allocate to another group who needs that space.\nThat's where IBM TRIRIGA determines a dynamic cost recovery rate and time period for which the space can be available to another group, and recommends which of the existing space requests to a space planner can be fulfilled by this availability.\nWhat is needed is a method to utilize occupancy sensors to recognize the disconnect between allocation and utilization.\nDisclosed is a system and method to apply insights from occupancy sensors or existing infrastructure, such as Wireless networks, compared with chargeback allocations and future space need, to determine the opportunity for another group to occupy and temporarily assume the chargeback.\nThis gives cost relief to the primary organization who carries the chargeback allocation and is done without manual input or specification within the chargeback allocation itself.\nA first user enters a floor space just like they would today. The floor could have a variety of space types associated, which may be, but is not limited to:\n- a conference room\n- an agile workspace (open air)\n- a phone booth\n- a dedicated desk\n- a dedicated cubicle\n- a floor\nThe system recognizes the entry of the first user through known real-time occupancy techniques. This could be done using existing infrastructure such as Wireless networks with third party solutions like the one from Cisco using DNA Spaces.\nThe identity of the individual and the corresponding organization the individual is associated with is connected via an integration with IBM TRIRIGA people data.\nThe organization determination from step 3 is passed along to a chargeback management tool such as IBM TRIRIGA to have an up-to-date accurate reflection of how each organization uses their allocated and unallocated space.\nOrganizations can then set threshold preferences of when to grow, reduce, or change their space allocation based on future and projected demand from anticipated growth in the business.\nThe system looks at the natural utilization trend by organization, such as seasonality, to determine or recommend how much space could be sub-allocated and for how long to another organization.\nExample preferences may include:\n- **Reduction of space**: Below x% threshold, for y days reduce z% of allocated space. If an organization has 50% of a floor, but for a month they only used a maximum of 40% of the space. Then they may choose to reallocate people to 45%.\n- **Increase of space**: If an organization recognizes a trend of growing usage across a space by the team, today they may be charged more when that space is not dedicated to the team. Using the proposed invention, the organization may be alerted to increase their allocation for cost savings.\n- **Re-organizing of layout**: If out of the last three months, 0 days were spent at desks A, B, and C, then the organization may want to remove those three desks. However, there are 3 desks near a high concentration of the organization staff that are allocated to another organization that the team tends to \"borrow\". So, swap desks A, B, C with desks X, Y, and Z that are closer to a concentration of the team.\n- **Budget correlation to booking systems**: Once an organization meets a monthly allocation for space, employees might be restricted from booking shared conference rooms so that the overall percentage of use by a business unit can be reduced to save costs.\n\n**Example**:\nBob is a facility manager. He has great visuals from existing technologies that show where employees are within a building and their assigned organization. However, these systems are limited in that they aren't based on actual movement of employees.\nThe proposed invention is turned on and connects with multiple occupancy sensors throughout the building. It turns out 75% of the hybrid cloud team doesn't come in and use their offices, and the AI applications team prefers to sit in their desks because the view out the window is better. The system suggests to Bob that he reallocate the desk spaces and reduce the amount of allotted space to the hybrid cloud team.",
